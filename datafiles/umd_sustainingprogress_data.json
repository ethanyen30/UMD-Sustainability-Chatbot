To celebrate Campus Sustainability Month and recognize the dynamic thinking, imagining and doing taking place at UMD, the Office of Sustainability pulled together new resources on resilience, justice, emotions and research to help you engage in the work we are doing together to respond to the realities of climate change. The University of Maryland is committed to addressing the grand challenges of today, including climate change. We accelerated our carbon neutrality commitment to 2025 and achieved our goal to halve carbon emissions by 2020 two years before schedule. These commitments and victories are milestones on UMD’s path to a more sustainable future. There is still plenty more progress to be made. UMD has also published carbon offset materials to support informed decision-making on emissions reductions and sustainable investments. Students, staff, and faculty can take action on sustainability at UMD through a variety of programs. Staff and faculty can participate in the Sustainability Badge program. Students can apply for the SustainableUMD Ambassador program. All can follow @SustainableUMD on social media, sign up for the newsletter, and explore sustainability data on UMD's progress dashboards.

        "Content": "Climate Change remains an urgent, defining issue of our time—one that demands continuing action by our  campus community, even as we cope with the twin pandemics of covid and racism. Thanks to a concerted effort over the past 13 years, we are on course to meet our rigorous climate change goals, and this will continue under my administration. We will continue to fulfill our pledge of net carbon neutrality on our campus and have accelerated our target date from 2050 to 2025.  Under the leadership of my predecessors, Dan Mote and Wallace Loh, we have made substantial progress, meeting all our targets. As pledged, by 2020 we have cut in half our campus’s carbon emissions compared to 2005 levels. We achieved this success through substantial changes in the way our campus operates. For example, we have transitioned to 100 percent renewable purchased electricity; installed a network of solar panels; and achieved carbon neutrality in our air travel. We have also improved stormwater management to prevent flash flooding in downstream communities, and we made certain that new campus buildings meet the highest environmental standards.\n\nThis success reflects a strong team effort by senior administrators, academic leaders, faculty, students, and dedicated staff in many units across campus. This was aided by the development of a culture of sustainability on campus that has drawn wide support and commitment. Along with thousands of public and private sector leaders, in 2018 our campus joined America’s Pledge—an effort to meet the goals of the Paris Accord—despite the U.S. withdrawal—through bottom-up action. We also joined the University Climate Coalition and serve as its research director. Our researchers have developed an array of beneficial projects, such as one to increase carbon retention by our campus arboretum. We have launched a Sustainability Studies Minor—one of the largest and most popular on campus for the past several years. Food service and housekeeping have instituted significant changes in their use of cleaning materials and encouraged recycling. Our Solar Decathlon team has become the winningest in the history of this international house-design competition. Student entrepreneurs have gone on to form startups like Imperfect Foods and Hungry Harvest—devoted to preventing food waste. Terp Farm grows food locally for use by dining services and distribution to people in need.\n\nThis progress will continue in coming years. Among the key targets ahead: reducing direct emissions from our combined heat and power plant, achieving zero emissions from our automotive fleet, reducing water consumption, and securing funding for needed, continual physical improvements.\n\nWe have gotten this far through a remarkable campus-wide team effort, supported by an effective culture of sustainability. With your continuing support, this will carry us to our goal of a fully sustainable campus with net carbon neutrality. Together, we are TerrapinSTRONG! Sincerely,  Darryll J. Pines\nPresident, University of Maryland "

There is plenty of opportunity for every person on campus to contribute toward reaching these goals!

The more people who choose carpooling, vanpooling, public transit, walking, or biking as a means of getting from one place to another, the greater those reductions will be. New housing projects located throughout College Park will increase options for living where you work/study.

To address the environmental impact of this travel, the university will implement a carbon offset program to negate 100% of the carbon emissions associated with air travel starting in 2018. A Carbon Offset Fund Committee reporting to the University Sustainability Council will select verified projects that sequester or prevent carbon emissions and determine the best process for administering the program.

UMD is progressing toward that goal through its broad array of degree granting programs, living-learning programs, and initiatives such as the Sustainability Advisors and Chesapeake Project. Year by year, students are increasingly likely to receive an introductory lesson on sustainability during their first semester, grapple with sustainability concepts in various courses spanning the academic disciplines, and get involved with sustainability-focused action-learning or research activities. Sustainability and climate change research at UMD continues to be among the best in the world and collaboration across disciplines as well as with campus operations departments helps those research activities flourish.

While Dining Halls had switched to reusable plates and utensils in 2016, eliminating 6.3 million disposable items from the university’s waste stream annually, this had to be placed on hold during the COVID-19 Pandemic. Compostable containers temporarily took the place of the reusable items to accommodate the challenges and risks of the time.In 2010 the need for thousands of disposable plastic liners for trash bins were eliminated by Facilities Managements' Can the Can program, where office workers received personal 'mini bins' to empty  into a centralized location, encouraging awareness of the amount of waste each individual creates."

        "Content": "Climate justice seeks to address the root causes of climate change while simultaneously tackling various social, racial, and environmental injustices (MIT Climate Portal, 2022). It acknowledges that climate change disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color. Central to climate justice is the concept of a just transition, which involves moving from fossil fuel-based economies to equitable, renewable energy-based systems; emphasizing sustainable practices; and instituting broad economic changes. It advocates for the fair distribution of both the benefits from activities causing climate change and the burdens of its impacts. Climate justice also emphasizes inclusive decision-making, prioritizing those most affected by climate change, and recognizing the threat it poses to basic human rights (University of California Center for Climate Justice, 2022). While both climate justice and environmental justice (EJ) seek to address inequities in environmental impacts and decision-making, they operate at different scales and focus on different aspects of environmental challenges. For example, EJ primarily deals with local and regional environmental issues, such as pollution and access to clean resources, whereas climate justice addresses the global impacts of climate change, emphasizing how climate change exacerbates social, racial, and economic inequalities. Moreover, EJ has roots in the civil rights movement and addresses a wide range of environmental harms beyond just climate change. Climate justice emerged more recently as awareness of the intersections between discrimination and the global climate crisis became more prominent. Climate justice focuses on ensuring that the impacts of climate action are distributed fairly and that vulnerable communities are supported in adaptation efforts. Both movements are crucial for achieving a comprehensive approach to addressing environmental and climate-related challenges (Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, 2022). "

        "Content": "Climate emotions are a broad category offeelings we experience in response to unfamiliar changesin the world that result directly or indirectly from the changing climate. As everything we have grown familiar with in our physical environments bears the changes associated with a warming world, the reality of this uncertainty is bringing a range of unexpected (and often uncomfortable) emotions to bear in our daily lives. One of the most pressing emotions related to the changing climate isclimate anxiety. As defined by the Cleveland Clinic, “climate anxiety is characterized by a chronic fear of environmental doom that’s often paralyzing and debilitating, and it can sometimes be exacerbated by existing anxiety disorders”. You may experience anxiety when you get news of disasters around the globe or wildfire smoke in your neighborhood. Not all emotions relating to the climate are negative. When walking around campus in the spring, you may experience joy from blooming cherry blossoms and other flowering plants. All the emotions that come from interactions or news of the climate are valid.Society will have to recalibrate itself to handle these new waves of fear, sadness, anger and even positivity.

The Arts for All program may be just as important to all Terps becoming climate ambassadors as the technical strategies that UMD is using to reduce and draw carbon out of the atmosphere. Art is a way to engage with our emotions and it can sharpen our self awareness and regulation skills for connecting with the challenges of climate change. The Fifth National Climate Assessment included an art gallery to show Americans' collective responses to the changing climates of the United States. Recent public health research shows that creating community climate art is an effective approach to navigating climate emotions. Collaborative creative practice is necessary to take action on climate change. The mission of Arts for All is to humanize grand challenges--such as the challenges brought on by a changing climate-- and to center people-based, creative processes as we work collectively to address them.

This could become a reality – research indicates that insect populations are currently declining at a rate of 1-2% each year (Janicki, 2022).  Confronted with this bleak observation, graduate student Helen Craig knew she needed to educate UMD students about the importance of insect biodiversity. However, she was well aware many students at UMD did not share her same interest. “Most individuals are fearful of insects or view them with a sense of disdain despite our dependence on them,” Craig said.   Craig had a passion for insects that began during her junior year of college while she was taking a freshwater biology course. After graduating from UMD in 2022 with a degree in Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Craig spent the following year as the Lab Manager of the Lamp Lab.  Throughout her time as an undergraduate, Craig experienced a general lack of knowledge about insects and their ecosystem services amongst the campus community. During her first year of graduate school, she received an email advertising UMD’s Sustainability Fund grant program and saw this as an opportunity to inform students about how crucial insects are to the environment In 2022, Craig received a Sustainability Fund grant to create three insect displays around UMD’s campus. Each display features a glass-covered box with pinned insects inside. The boxes are surrounded by informational posters explaining why insects are vital to a healthy environment and how they impact student’s everyday lives.  "

        "Content": "The process of creating these displays took a year. Craig collected the bugs with the help of students Yasmine Helbling, Felicia Shechtman, UMD Bug Club, and more. “Collectively, it took over 40 hours to collect all of the insects for the displays,” said Helbling.  The featured insects were collected from a wide array of locations. This included on-campus locations like the Bee Wall and the Community Learning Garden, and off-campus locations like Lake Artemesia and even their own homes. The group then spent over 100 hours over the course of a few months working to “preserve them, pin them, label them, and sort them into different ecosystem services,” Craig said.  Fiona Török, a senior Graphic Design student at UMD, was brought on to the project in May 2023 to create the information posters. “I immediately knew I wanted to apply because it combines my two biggest passions - design and sustainability,” Török said. She spent six months designing the three main posters and six informational cards in each display case. Török emphasized how much deliberation went into the images and text displayed on each poster.  “We wanted the images to be eye-catching and colorful without being childish and oversimplified,” Török said. Her goal was to emphasize “the two-sided coin of how important insects are, and why it is so concerning that they are rapidly disappearing.” At each installation, the posters capture student interest by connecting the displayed insects to information about their services in the ecosystem and the overwhelming impacts of an insect apocalypse.  “I hope students consider how their field of study or future career is tied to insects and how they can be an advocate or ally,” said Craig. To help students understand this connection, the displays offer QR codes. The codes link to a website prompting students to select their major, then provide additional articles and videos about how insects play a role in their specific field of interest.  "

More than just bug enthusiasts contributed to the displays: each case is adorned with intricate paper insects made by students in the Origami Club. Török hopes that students will take the time to learn something new as they pass the displays throughout their day, “Perhaps it will make them think about how the smallest things can have the biggest impact,” Török said.  One day, Craig hopes to have a fourth installation in Stamp Student Union. For now, students, staff, and faculty can visit the displays in the three locations on campus. "

        "Content": "Carbon sources are activities or processes that release greenhouse gases, such as fossil fuel combustion, industrial production, and deforestation, contributing to the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In contrast, carbon sinks—natural systems like forests, soils, and oceans—absorb and store carbon, helping to reduce atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. Carbon offset projects leverage these principles by funding activities that either reduce emissions from carbon sources or enhance the capacity of carbon sinks. According to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol for Project Accounting, a carbon offset project is defined as a specific activity or set of activities designed to achieve one or more of the following outcomes: These projects are implemented with the explicit goal of generating quantifiable and verifiable reductions in GHG emissions or increases in carbon sequestration, which can then be used to compensate for emissions occurring elsewhere. By enabling organizations and individuals to balance their carbon footprints, carbon offset projects play a vital role in global climate change mitigation. This concept of balancing emissions with offsets is at the core of carbon neutrality, where the ultimate goal is to ensure that human activities do not result in a net addition of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere.

        "Content": "A carbon offset provides a mechanism for individuals and organizations to mitigate their greenhouse gas emissions by investing in projects that either reduce or remove carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. When a carbon offset is purchased, the funds typically support initiatives such as renewable energy projects, reforestation efforts, or methane capture from landfills. Each offset credit generally represents the reduction of one metric ton (2,205 lbs) of carbon dioxide. These credits and the projects that generate them undergo verification by independent third-party certifiers to ensure that the emission reductions are genuine, quantifiable and additional. The resulting verified carbon credits are then made available for purchase on a carbon market. By acquiring these credits, individuals and organizations can effectively neutralize the impact of emissions that cannot be directly reduced within their own operations. "

Ensuring that offsets are real, measurable, additional, and verified is essential to maintaining their credibility. There is also the risk that some projects may not deliver the intended environmental benefits or could cause unintended harm. UMD prioritizes sourcing high-quality offsets that meet rigorous standards to address these concerns.Benefits of Carbon OffsettingCarbon offsets provide an immediate way to mitigate global emissions, allowing institutions like UMD to take action now while planning for long-term sustainability. Developing greenhouse gas reduction strategies often requires significant upfront investment, extensive planning, and market adjustments—barriers that can delay progress. By supporting projects that actively remove or capture emissions off-site, UMD can make a tangible short-term impact while working toward long-term reductions in its emissions."

        "Content": "Carbon offsetting is one of several strategies employed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale. While it plays a role in climate action, it's important to recognize that a comprehensive approach to addressing the climate crisis requires multiple facets. These include significant capital investment in clean technologies and infrastructure, extensive research and development to innovate sustainable solutions, and widespread cultural behavior change to adopt more environmentally friendly practices. Carbon offsetting functions as a market-based strategy that can help facilitate some of these changes. It provides a mechanism for individuals and organizations to take immediate action on their carbon footprint while also contributing funds to projects that advance climate goals. However, it should be viewed as part of a broader suite of actions rather than a standalone solution to the complex challenge of climate change."

Don’t worry, set up an appointment with the free Terp to Terp Campus ReUse Store and grab what you need. Terp to Terp was created to respond to the essential needs of students while encouraging a culture of reuse, social responsibility, and waste minimization. Collecting and distributing unused or gently used small appliances, kitchen items, room accessories, and school supplies, Terp to Terp is a free resource available to all UMD students. Donations are collected throughout the year at the Campus Pantry or during Spring semester move out through donation drives likeTerps Move-out Donation Drive. The benefits of the free reuse store are immense — Terp to Terp encourages social responsibility by offering opportunities to reallocate useful items to individuals in need, preventing landfill waste and saving the University and students money. The University of Maryland strongly emphasizes waste minimization and diversion, offering campus-wide composting, recycling, and specialty recycling (glass, e-Waste, etc.). Other campus units implement targeted programs to help reduce waste generation within their operational areas, for example theOcean Friendly Campus initiativeby Dining Services orTerrapin Traderby the Office of Procurement and Business Services. Facilities Management considers waste reduction even during building construction, finding opportunities to reuse materials from demolition or using materials with recycled content when possible. Terp to Terp continues Res Life's nearly two-decades long effort to encourage waste reduction and social sustainability through the Terps Move-Out Donation Drive and other programs likeGreen Terp. It works alongside programs likethe Campus Pantryandthe Student Crisis Fundto support and foster success for all Terps. Since the pilot began in 2021, Terp to Terp has rapidly expanded, moving from a small storage closet to a storefront in Harford Hall, tripling students served and quadrupling donations between the first and second year of the program. Terp to Terp is a free resource available to UMD students. Students are encouraged to schedule an appointment online at:reslife.umd.edu/terptoterp.  "

        "Content": "Climate justice seeks to address the root causes of climate change while simultaneously tackling various social, racial, and environmental injustices (MIT Climate Portal, 2022). It acknowledges that climate change disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color. Central to climate justice is the concept of a just transition, which involves moving from fossil fuel-based economies to equitable, renewable energy-based systems; emphasizing sustainable practices; and instituting broad economic changes. It advocates for the fair distribution of both the benefits from activities causing climate change and the burdens of its impacts. Climate justice also emphasizes inclusive decision-making, prioritizing those most affected by climate change, and recognizing the threat it poses to basic human rights (University of California Center for Climate Justice, 2022). While both climate justice and environmental justice (EJ) seek to address inequities in environmental impacts and decision-making, they operate at different scales and focus on different aspects of environmental challenges. For example, EJ primarily deals with local and regional environmental issues, such as pollution and access to clean resources, whereas climate justice addresses the global impacts of climate change, emphasizing how climate change exacerbates social, racial, and economic inequalities. Moreover, EJ has roots in the civil rights movement and addresses a wide range of environmental harms beyond just climate change. Climate justice emerged more recently as awareness of the intersections between discrimination and the global climate crisis became more prominent. Climate justice focuses on ensuring that the impacts of climate action are distributed fairly and that vulnerable communities are supported in adaptation efforts. Both movements are crucial for achieving a comprehensive approach to addressing environmental and climate-related challenges (Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, 2022). "

That year, UMD became a charter signatory of The Presidents' Climate Leadership Carbon Commitment. In Fall 2009, after two years of internal planning and collaboration, the university announced target years for greenhouse gas reductions as well as a long-term target date for carbon neutrality.  \"Carbon neutrality is defined as reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and offsetting remaining emissions so that net emissions to the atmosphere are zero.\" - University of Maryland Climate Action Plan 1.0, August 2009 Between 2009 and 2021, the university met or surpassed all short term targets set for net greenhouse gas reductions. President Pines announced that UMD would accelerate its target date for carbon neutrality from 2050 to 2025 when he gave his inaugural speech on Earth Day in April 2021. He took this even further by announcing a fossil-fuel free target year of 2035 for the campus heat and power plant when he welcomed the community back for the 2022 Fall Semester. The Climate Action Plan is a living document that summarizes evolving pathways that UMD is using to reduce operational greenhouse gas emissions and offset remaining residual emissions. "

For each strategy, the university aims to provide more clarity around the quantification of emissions impacts for the adopted strategies. The university measures greenhouse gas emissions on an annual basis. For strategies with quantifiable targets, the plan provides estimated emissions reduction targets and cumulative emissions impact compared to a 2022 baseline. The estimated emissions reduction is the sum of the predicted emissions avoided due to climate action strategies implemented during each discrete year. The cumulative emissions impact is the sum of the predicted emissions avoided annually against a 2022 baseline year or an alternative baseline year stated in the strategy. The emission reduction estimates are influenced by the availability and accuracy of data and the current methodologies for quantifying and predicting greenhouse gas emissions by sector.

        "Content": "Occupying over 1,450 acres of land across the State of Maryland, the University of Maryland, College Park is the equivalent of a small city. The university powers more than 250 campus buildings through a district energy system consisting of generated and purchased power. The central energy plant supplies the full thermal demand and approximately 30-70% of the electrical demand of the main campus depending on the season and operational availability of the generating equipment. The remaining electricity for the main campus and power used at 135 buildings on UMD satellite campuses is purchased from the grid. As of 2020, all grid-purchased electricity is renewably-sourced as part of the university’s climate action strategies to mitigate the greenhouse gas emissions associated with powering the campus. Currently, the university’s scope 1 power-related emissions represents approximately 68% of the university’s gross greenhouse gas emissions. Compared to a 2005 baseline, UMD has reduced power-related emissions 39% and eliminated all scope 2 emissions. The university’s progress in power emissions reductions is tied to federal and state funding, the national grid, innovation in sustainable energy technology, and investment and operation of campus infrastructure. Estimated emissions reductions are tied to state regulation and the availability of mid- to low-cost, scalable sustainable energy technology. The following energy climate action strategies are predicted to reduce or offset greenhouse gas emissions between 1,152,000 - 1,169,000 MTCO2e during 2025-2040. These strategies capture UMD's institutional commitments to reduce power-related greenhouse gas emissions; they represent things that can be controlled centrally by administrative departments. However, President Pines has called on all of us to be climate ambassadors, so: Students, staff, and faculty drive energy consumption through use of campus facilities, equipment, and other energy-consuming behaviors. There are many opportunities for every person on campus to contribute toward reaching these goals! The UMD campus community can collectively save over 10,000 MTCO2e by 2025 through everyday behaviors like turning off computers, lights, and other equipment when not in use. Research at centers like the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute and Center for Global Sustainability can support the clean energy transition locally, nationally, and internationally. Students, staff, and faculty are encouraged to learn more about sustainable energy through programs, courses, and other resources.   "

Additional information about the NextGen Energy program will be available at the conclusion of the procurement and permitting processes. Currently, the campus generates energy using a central energy plant that burns natural gas and ultra low sulfur diesel during periods of gas interruption. The university also uses fuel oil in other stationary sources, such as emergency generators. The fuel burned in the central energy plant currently accounts for approximately 70% of gross greenhouse gas emissions. To transition to a more sustainable, resilient, and decarbonized energy system, the university may need to increase electrical capacity on campus, convert high-pressure and high-temperature steam to more efficient hot water systems, and investigate opportunities to transition equipment and buildings to more sustainable and resilient energy sources. Estimated emissions are based on predicted changes to the campus energy system at this part of the procurement process. The NextGen Energy Program strategies are predicted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at minimum between 120,000 - 122,500 MTCO2e during 2025-2040. "

These ODCs — most commonly HVAC refrigerants or chemicals with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs) — are known to destroy the ozone layer, an important part of the stratosphere that protects the earth from UV-B radiation and prevents global warming. With global warming potentials thousands of times more potent than carbon dioxide and a hundred times more potent than methane, it is a global interest to mitigate ODCs wherever possible. The university tracks and reports emissions of ODCs through regulatory and voluntary environmental reports. As of 2022, refrigerant and chemical emissions account for approximately 1% of the university’s greenhouse gas emissions. To mitigate climate impacts, the university is exploring more sustainable alternatives and improving equipment to reduce refrigerant and chemical emissions. Estimated emissions impacts are limited by availability of sustainable alternatives and success of the pilot program. The following refrigerant and chemical strategy is estimated to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 5 - 100 MTCO2e during 2025-2040 and provide a starting point to better understand how to mitigate refrigerant and chemical emissions on campus.  This strategy captures the university's institutional commitment to understand, identify and invest in opportunities to mitigate refrigerant & chemical greenhouse gas emissions, including potentially low-impact strategies. Operational units at UMD control their choice of how to manage refrigerant procurement,  replacement and retirement for HVAC and other equipment. It is important for all of us to think about how we can participate too: Most reported emissions are currently from operations of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems around campus. Students, faculty and staff can make a service request when HVAC systems are not functioning as normal, or a leak is noticed. In research labs, personnel can ensure they are following green chemical procurement suggestions where feasible. Appropriate disposal of chemicals is also important to reducing fugitive emissions.

These transportation services include vehicles, buses, and other equipment that consume a variety of fuels: gasoline, diesel, flex fuel, propane, natural gas, biodiesel (B20 and B5), and electricity. The consumption of these fuels directly contributes to the university’s scope 1 greenhouse gas emissions. The university is committed to transitioning the campus vehicle fleet, including the bus fleet, by 2035 to zero emission vehicles to reduce associated direct transportation emissions. Additional strategies to right-size the campus fleet and provide appropriate infrastructure to support a zero emissions vehicle fleet will contribute to the university’s fleet emissions goals.  The university’s progress in campus fleet emissions reductions is tied to availability of market replacements for zero emissions heavy-duty vehicles, light-duty vehicles, vans, sedans, and other transportation equipment. Estimated emissions reductions are tied to the availability and rate of replacement. The following fleet strategies are predicted to reduce greenhouse gas emissions between 22,000 - 37,000 MTCO2e during 2025-2040.   These strategies capture UMD's institutional commitments to reduce fleet transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions; they represent things that can be controlled centrally by administrative departments. However, President Pines has called on all of us to be climate ambassadors, so: Staff, students, and faculty can explore opportunities to reduce reliance on single-occupancy or internal combustion engine vehicles to commute around campus on the Department of Transportation Services website. Units with fleet equipment can work with the Office of Sustainability and Facilities Management to right-size their fleet, explore low- or no-emissions equipment options and plan strategic transitions. In addition to direct action, student and faculty research and academics can support the fleet transition. For example, student interns worked with Campus GIS to map the mobility of the university’s fleet for the right-sizing study. The UMD-based Build America Center supported the Department of Transportation on a $39.9 million dollar grant to fund the first 35 all-electric ShuttleUM buses. "

        "Content": "As Maryland's land grant institution, UMD owns and operates a significant amount of land throughout the State of Maryland, from main campus in College Park to extension farms as far as Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore. The use of land has greenhouse gas emissions implications. The main campus is a registered arboretum, and significant maintenance is performed to maintain the green spaces, pollinator and food gardens, and wooded areas. These activities generate emissions through fertilizer application (nitrogen) and fuel consumption. On the agriculture extension farms, UMD raises dairy, angus cattle, and crops and performs research. These activities generate emissions through animal digestion (methane), fertilizer application (nitrogen), and fuel consumption in operations. Ecologically, land may be a carbon sink that stores carbon in soil, trees, cover crops, and other greenery. In 2020, the university began a research project to measure the campus forest carbon flux. (Stored carbon—in soil, forests, water systems—is in flux, impacted by temperature, weather events, and human intervention.) However, this research continues and university forest carbon is not currently included in greenhouse gas emissions inventory. Looking forward, the university will continue investigating opportunities to incorporate campus land sinks into the greenhouse gas inventory; invest in low- or no-emission equipment for landscaping; and where possible, reduce emissions associated with agriculture and fertilizer use.   These strategies capture institutional actions to reduce land-use management related greenhouse gas emissions on campus.  Students, staff, and faculty are encouraged to enjoy the natural resources provided by campus. Being kind to the natural spaces around campus can help keep the ecosystems healthy and reduce maintenance for those areas. Individuals and groups can take direct action to support campus green spaces by volunteering with the Arboretum and Botanical Gardens.  At the Agricultural Research and Education Centers, researchers are exploring different mechanisms to reduce climate impacts of agriculture. Some examples of research on campus include efforts to capture biodiversity of green spaces and the impact of connecting people to natural spaces. "

        "Content": " Compared to a 2005 baseline, solid waste related greenhouse gas emissions have decreased more than 90%. The university accomplished this by greatly expanding waste minimization efforts, recycling, and composting — driving a reduction of landfill solid waste by more than 50% and decreasing overall waste generation by more than 44%. Currently, solid waste represents approximately 1% of the university’s total greenhouse gas emissions. The university has also prioritized working with sustainable waste management systems. For example, since 2008 UMD has sent remaining solid waste to landfills that generate electricity using captured methane, a potent greenhouse gas.  This significant progress highlights the university’s commitment to sustainable waste management. Through partnerships with local waste management companies and constant outreach to the campus community, the Recycling and Solid Waste, Dining Services, Office of Environmental Affairs, and several other major units have successfully implemented waste reduction, minimization and landfill diversion strategies. These include: single-stream recycling, twinned bins, mini-bins, composting, battery recycling, e-Waste recycling, and other initiatives. In addition, other campus units support reuse and waste minimization through programs such as the Campus Pantry, Food Recovery Network, Terrapin Trader, and Terp to Terp ReUse Campus Store. Looking ahead, the campus can directly impact carbon neutrality efforts in solid waste management by generating less waste and by directing more recyclable and compostable materials in the correct receptacles. Estimated emissions impacts will be affected by the successes of these actions and by new state legislation, including the 2021 Food Residual Diversion law. The following solid waste strategies are predicted to reduce solid waste related scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions between 720 - 1,330 MTCO2e during 2025-2040.    These strategies capture both individual and institutional actions to reduce solid waste related greenhouse gas emissions on campus.    The university is committed to sending waste to sustainable waste management facilities and reducing waste generation during construction, demolition, and day-to-day operations. Through programs like Ocean Friendly Campus, zero-waste event guides and other programs, the SustainableUMD Network aims to create space for low- and no-waste programs on campus. Individual action plays a part before the university’s commitments step in: Before buying new, consider checking Terrapin Trader or Terp to Terp for gently-used items. Before disposing in a bin, consider if the material is reusable or donatable. When at the bins, follow sorting recommendations to ensure UMD can properly divert waste from landfills as often as possible. "

        "Content": " The University of Maryland, College Park is committed to being a national center for research, education, and service, aiming to advance knowledge in areas of importance to the state, nation, and world. Air travel is an important part of the university’s global presence, however it contributes approximately 10% of the university’s average annual total greenhouse gas emissions. UMD encourages sustainable decisions around air and other travel related to the essential functions of the university — faculty travel for research, student study abroad, athletic competitions, and business operations — to help reduce climate and other environmental impacts. UMD has addressed the climate impact of necessarily air travel since 2017 through the Carbon Neutral Air Travel initiative. This initiative established a requirement to offset 100% of the carbon emissions associated with air travel through the procurement of real, measurable, additional, and verified carbon offsets. In the years ahead, UMD will continue to reduce the scope 3 emissions associated with air travel by prioritizing sustainable travel choices and monitoring industry-wide improvements in aircraft and associated fuels and governmental commitments like the Sustainable Aviation Fuel Grand Challenge. Estimated emissions reductions are tied to the success of industry sustainability transitions. Between 2025-2040, the Carbon Neutral Air Travel initiative is predicted to offset 460,000 - 500,000 MTCO2e of UMD’s greenhouse gas emissions.   While the university has direct control over emissions sources like on-campus energy infrastructure, it has minimal control over emissions associated with the aviation industry.    Students, staff, and faculty can mitigate air travel emissions through virtual meetings and by using low-carbon options like trains and buses, especially when traveling locally and within certain distances. As the aviation industry increases sustainable travel options through low-carbon fuel or low-carbon flights, the university can encourage booking more sustainable flights. Researchers at Maryland can contribute to the global sustainable transition of the aviation industry. For example, a researcher in the School of Engineering is researching hybrid-electric power sources for narrow-body aircrafts; and researchers in the School of Public Policy are investigating aviation decarbonization pathways in the Global Change Analysis Model (GCAM).

Increasingly, students, faculty, and staff are choosing sustainable alternatives to single-occupancy commuting. Those that drive alone are also switching to fuel-efficient or zero-emissions vehicles. Between incentives to purchase zero- or low-emissions vehicles and increasing availability of low-carbon micro-mobility options, it is becoming easier to commute sustainably to campus. Further, sustainable development of the campus and surrounding communities continues to bring housing options closer to campus, reducing commuting distances traveled when commuting.  Commuting is a significant portion of the greenhouse gas emissions, contributing an estimated 14% of the university’s gross greenhouse gas footprint. In 2018, undergraduate students committed to offsetting 100% of their commuting greenhouse gas emissions. Remaining commuting emissions are associated with graduate student, staff, and faculty commuting. Through programs like Shuttle-UM, the Purple Line, SmartCommute, micromobility, and EV charging among other initiatives, the campus aims to sustain and further mitigate commuting emissions. Between 2025-2040, the Undergraduate Commuting Carbon Neutrality program and other commuting strategies are predicted to offset or mitigate 178,500 - 205,000 MTCO2e of UMD’s greenhouse gas emissions.   These strategies capture both individual and institutional actions to reduce commuting related greenhouse gas emissions on campus.     The university continues to provide alternative transportation support to commuters through Shuttle-UM, Purple Line, VeoRides, SmartCommute and other partnerships. The Department of Transportation Services at UMD provides resources to help individuals bike, walk, carpool, and public transit to work. To effectively mitigate emissions, individuals on campus must choose to use these resources rather than relying on fossil-fuel powered options.  Living closer to the campus when possible can also help reduce commuting emissions. The College Park City-University Partnership is one example of the university working with the local governments around campus to sustainably develop the area. For example, the Homeownership Program has helped more than 170 employees with down payments for homes within the city limits. "

Despite this, UMD prioritizes the opportunity to reduce the environmental impacts associated with procurement, including the manufacturing, transportation, and use of food, electronics, equipment, furniture, and other goods and services. The university tracks progress in sustainable procurement through regulatory and voluntary reports, including the Coolfood Pledge, the STARS Report, and Maryland Green Purchasing reports. The State of Maryland established the environmentally preferable purchasing program and Maryland Green Purchasing Committee in 2010 with the Green Maryland Act. Sustainability in procurement includes purchasing sustainable goods and also working with service providers that aim to independently meet sustainability commitments. For example, the university’s new enterprise system Workday has significant commitments to corporate sustainability and Shell Shop, UMD’s online store, holds the potential to drive purchasing to more sustainable alternatives. Dining Services has prioritized partnering with local food providers, including a recent partnership with Albright Farms in Monkton, MD. UMD has also set internal requirements to purchase sustainable products and work with sustainable contractors where possible. For example, UMD purchases computers that meet EPEAT and Energy Star ratings and the Arboretum and Botanical Gardens recently switched to fully electric leaf blowers and requires outside contractors to use electric blowers when working on campus. By reducing consumption of goods, selecting goods that meet sustainability criteria, and working with contractors who provide sustainable products and services, the university’s greenhouse gas reductions can be significant. The Department of Procurement and Business Services, Division of Information Technology, Facilities Management, Department of Dining Services, and other major units are driving efforts to increase sustainability in the core of the university’s purchasing decisions.   Purchasing sustainable products and services reduces climate impacts. With sustainable purchasing commitments and guidance from the institution, individuals should choose the more sustainable option in the near and long-term.   Students, staff and faculty are encouraged to make sustainable purchasing and travel decisions at UMD. For example, when planning events consider the sustainability-minded events guide. Or when purchasing office supplies, review the Environmentally Preferable Procurement guidelines and Maryland Green Purchasing committee materials. While the university develops guidelines and resources for sustainably-minded procurement, it is the responsibility of the individual to ensure these commitments are met.   "

The SDGs “recognize that ending poverty and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequality, and spur economic growth - all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our oceans and forests” (sdgs.un.org/goals). This 17-goal-agenda provides an international framework for addressing social issues like climate change, social injustice, global health, and education disparities. At federal, state, and local levels, there are additional regulations and frameworks to guide sustainable development. Some of these policies directly impact the university’s Climate Action Plan as captured by the above strategies. As a leading research institution, the University of Maryland, College Park recognizes the role of research and academics in addressing climate change and other sustainable development issues. The University Strategic Plan, Fearlessly Forward, emphasizes UMD’s commitment to addressing grand challenges and fostering a community that is collaborative, innovative, diverse and inclusive. UMD is actively investing in a community for sustainable research and academic excellence. In 2022, UMD awarded $30 million dollars in institutional funding with one-to-one matching grants to sustainability-related research. Academic disciplines throughout the university offer sustainability majors, minors, and living-learning programs. Year by year, students are increasingly likely to receive an introductory lesson on sustainability during their first semester through the Sustainability Advisors program, engage in sustainability concepts in various courses, and get involved with sustainability-focused action-learning, research, or extracurricular activities. Many of the schools and colleges are actively expanding sustainability research and learning as recently evidenced by the School of Public Health establishing the new Department of Global, Environmental, and Occupational Health. The new department, opening in Fall 2024, will focus on climate change, global health impacts, pandemic preparedness and environmental justice.  The university also supports the creation and the implementation of sustainable strategies and technologies state-wide. For example, the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute and the Center for Global Sustainability (CGS) have played key roles in climate change in Maryland.  CGS has supported the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) in the development of strategies and data models to support Maryland’s ambitious climate goals. Moreover, over the past six years, the state has provided $9 Million to the Maryland Energy Innovation Institute (MEI2) from the Strategic Energy Investment Fund (SEIF). The purpose of the SEIF is to decrease energy demand and increase energy supply to promote affordable, reliable, and clean energy. MEI2 uses the funding to support the research, development and commercialization of clean energy technologies throughout Maryland. There are many opportunities to continue improving sustainability education and research at UMD. The strategies below further capture the university’s commitment to addressing the grand challenge of climate change and creating a well-educated community.   Opportunities are endless to incorporate sustainability into research and learning. From degree programs to research projects to living-learning programs, students and faculty learn, enhance, and find support for addressing sustainability issues. The Grand Challenges Grants from 2022 were the most recent and significant investment in sustainability research at UMD. The university established a legacy in supporting sustainability academics and research well before issuing these grants. As a signatory of the Carbon Commitment in 2007, UMD set an ambitious goal to educate all students about sustainability. In external sustainability reporting, UMD ranks among the top universities for sustainability related research. In an inventory of 2020 research projects, more than 64% of faculty conducted research relating to sustainability. In a similar inventory of courses, more than 26% of courses included some aspect of sustainability. Each year, the sustainability studies minor enrolls more than 300 students from multiple academic disciplines at UMD.   Moving forward, students, staff, and faculty can encourage sustainability literacy by participating in programs like Green Workspaces, the Sustainability Advisors, or by partnering with other units on sustainability-related programs. All members of the community are eligible to apply for funding from the Sustainability Fund.     The University of Maryland is home to many energy-related centers dedicated to working across disciplinary boundaries and transforming science research. Behind the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions is the global energy sector, and especially the burning of fossil fuels for electricity, heat, and transportation. (The International Energy Agency estimates that energy accounts for more than three-quarters of total greenhouse gas emissions globally.) The impacts of climate change—extreme weather and natural disasters among them—cycle back to the energy sector, where they can threaten local and global energy supplies, systems, and infrastructure. Engineering humanity away from the challenges of climate change demands a reset in how society thinks about, produces, and uses energy. At the University of Maryland researchers, faculty, and students are already rising to the grand challenge of researching, developing, and commercializing the clean energy technologies that meet society’s urgent needs for a sustainable future. Going beyond the technologies themselves, the university is also partnering with the State to deepen a culture of energy innovation. The MEI Energy Seed Grant Program helps faculty and students bridge the gap between academic transformative laboratory research results and prototype demonstrations to obtain investor interest. All members of the university community are eligible to apply for funding from the Energy Innovation Seed Grant program.   "

        "Content": "Climate emotions are a broad category offeelings we experience in response to unfamiliar changesin the world that result directly or indirectly from the changing climate. As everything we have grown familiar with in our physical environments bears the changes associated with a warming world, the reality of this uncertainty is bringing a range of unexpected (and often uncomfortable) emotions to bear in our daily lives. One of the most pressing emotions related to the changing climate isclimate anxiety. As defined by the Cleveland Clinic, “climate anxiety is characterized by a chronic fear of environmental doom that’s often paralyzing and debilitating, and it can sometimes be exacerbated by existing anxiety disorders”. You may experience anxiety when you get news of disasters around the globe or wildfire smoke in your neighborhood. Not all emotions relating to the climate are negative. When walking around campus in the spring, you may experience joy from blooming cherry blossoms and other flowering plants. All the emotions that come from interactions or news of the climate are valid.Society will have to recalibrate itself to handle these new waves of fear, sadness, anger and even positivity.

The Arts for All program may be just as important to all Terps becoming climate ambassadors as the technical strategies that UMD is using to reduce and draw carbon out of the atmosphere. Art is a way to engage with our emotions and it can sharpen our self awareness and regulation skills for connecting with the challenges of climate change. The Fifth National Climate Assessment included an art gallery to show Americans' collective responses to the changing climates of the United States. Recent public health research shows that creating community climate art is an effective approach to navigating climate emotions. Collaborative creative practice is necessary to take action on climate change. The mission of Arts for All is to humanize grand challenges--such as the challenges brought on by a changing climate-- and to center people-based, creative processes as we work collectively to address them.

This website consolidates goals and strategies published in various documents to make it clear to see the University of Maryland’s trajectory related to sustainability. The goals presented here do not reflect all campus sustainability goals, the full breadth of sustainability work being carried out, nor preclude the development of new goals and strategies. The campus sustainability effort is one that continues to evolve, inspires creativity and recognizes the critical importance of collaboration both internally and externally. The aspirational goal of being a national model of a green university requires constant innovation, flexibility and the recognition of new and better approaches. "

For over a decade, Dining Services has worked to build the foundation of UMD's current sustainable food culture alongside students, staff, and faculty. To support the University’s climate action goals, the 2012 Sustainable Food Commitment set targets to procure 20% local and sustainable food by 2020, increase sustainable food purchases 1-4% annually, and to incrementally increase procurement of unprocessed whole foods and foods from local growers each year. By 2015, UMD’s Dining Services accomplished the Sustainable Food Procurement target and was well into maintaining the three remaining strategies. In almost every year over the past decade, Dining Services established new sustainability programs. This progress underscores their unwavering dedication to providing nutritious and accessible food to the entire campus community while reducing the environmental impacts of their operations.

        "Content": "Maryland Dining Services continues to move forward with ambitious goals to combat climate change. In partnership with the Menus of Change University Research Collaborative and the Cool Food Pledge, Dining will increase transparency and stringency surrounding food procurement. The new goal of reducing food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 25% below 2017 levels by 2030 is in line with keeping global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and supports the climate action targets at the University of Maryland and global sustainability goals like the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Through a new, detailed reporting process, carbon emissions associated with the food served at UMD will be calculated and tracked annually. Analysis of the 2021 food procurement showed per-plate emissions have been reduced by over 34% since 2017. In Fall 2022, Dining launched the Cool Food Meals climate labeling program to identify menu items that have been verified by the World Resources Institute as both low-carbon and healthy. Guests can find Cool Food Meals in the South Campus and 251 North Dining Halls and join in the effort to reduce UMD's food-related greenhouse gas emissions. On-going projects including Terp Farm and the campus Farmers Market will continue to foster vibrant local food systems at the University and within the broader community. Dining aims to expand support for Maryland farmers through a partnership with the MD Department of Agriculture’s Local Farm Enterprise, and recently partnered with Albright Farms from Monkton, MD to locally source all shell eggs for the dining halls. At the annual Harvest Festival event held in October, executive Chefs create a dinner menu highlighting our local sourcing partnerships and farmers come to campus to visit with students. Beyond sustainable food purchasing, achieving a hunger-free UMD remains central to the Green Dining program. With support from Dining Services, the Campus Pantry and the Food Recovery Network group will continue their important work addressing food insecurity on campus and in the surrounding area. Dining Services also opened the first carbon neutral dining facility in Fall 2022. The Yahentamitsi Dining Hall embodies Dining Services commitment to incorporate sustainability into operations and dining spaces with LEED design, energy and water efficient equipment. “Yahentamitsi” (Yah-hen-tuh-meet-c), means “a place to go to eat” in the Algonquian language spoken by the Piscataway, who are indigenous to Maryland.

        "Content": "Colleen Wright-Riva arrived at UMD in 2007 as the Director of Dining Services and found that there was “virtually no composting.” Inspired by campus-wide composting at Cornell University — where she was previously dining director — Wright-Riva thought, “If we could do it at Cornell, why couldn’t we do it here?” Composting on campus began when Wright-Riva trained the dish room and kitchen staff to compost. The program was strengthened with the help of a graduate assistant and Dining Services. Education about composting directed toward students, faculty, and staff streamlined the process, making connections with not only students, but also the Residence Hall Association and the Student Government Association. “I think in some ways, that happened through people’s own awareness about the environment,” she said. “A lot of messaging around about Mother Earth, and Earth Day activities, and our farmers markets…” Wright-Riva credits the “symbiotic” collaboration of the Office of Sustainability, Facilities Management, and Dining Services for the success  of the composting program.  More than 8,000 short tons of waste have been composted since composting began in 2009, with most being utilized at  Terp Farm. Aside from her composting program, Wright-Riva has advanced sustainability on campus in a number of ways, including the creation of the Farmers Markets, the Campus Pantry, and the first sustainability position in Dining Services. Wright-Riva is proud of the sustainable developments the university has made, such as campus-wide composting, teaching students about food and health, and getting rid of styrofoam. “All of it happened because people got jazzed about doing the right thing,” she said.

        "Content": "Scott Lupin established the Office of Sustainability in 2007, kickstarting UMD students’ connection to sustainability on campus and furthering environmental initiatives. He currently serves as the Director of the Office of Sustainability and the Associate Director for the Department of Environmental Safety, Sustainability & Risk. Starting in 2002, Lupin focused on environmental compliance and regulation, while building momentum for sustainability programs through early sustainability-focused higher education conferences. In 2006, the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) challenged universities to commit to carbon neutrality and develop a Climate Action Plan. UMD was among the first 100 signatories to commit to the pledge, and the Vice President of Administration, Doug Duncan, asked Lupin to start the Office of Sustainability shortly after. Lupin and his work group developed methods for measuring the university’s greenhouse gas footprint and created a Climate Action Plan — two things that the university had never done before. Over the years, the Office of Sustainability received more staff and funds, allowing Lupin to expand the office’s outreach and continue to further the university’s commitment to sustainability. Lupin believes the Office of Sustainability presents the university not only with support towards achieving the goal of carbon neutrality, but also provides students with educational experience in the field of sustainability. The office has facilitated internships and programs through the Sustainability Fund to give students “real world experience in the field,” he said. Lupin believes that sustainability has expanded at the university over the years, ranging from opportunities for students to dedicated sustainability positions within departments. “I think we’ve had a much broader, deeper impact than anyone ever anticipated when the office was established,” he said.

        "Content": "Karen Petroff, the Director of Landscape and Special Services, worked to found and accredit the UMD Arboretum and Botanical Garden, which refers to the 1,250 acres of UMD College Park’s campus. Petroff and administrators changed the management structure and goals of the university landscape before the Arboretum was officially founded in 2008, which meant focusing on education and using the plants as teaching tools. The Arboretum was accredited in 2019, furthering the validity of the importance of the Arboretum and its work. Petroff credits a passionate student for gathering information and handling paperwork to obtain accreditation, while she worked to foster outside partnerships, such as with the United States Department of Agriculture. Petroff also helped to identify and document the plants present across the campus-wide arboretum. Additionally, Petroff and a team obtained the accreditation of Tree Campus Higher Education, which awards universities who engage the campus community in arbor-related activities. UMD was one of twenty-five founding members of the program in 2008. Petroff believes that students have been happy to engage with the arboretum, highlighting the many Fraternity and Sorority Life and professional organizations that collaborate with the arboretum. “Students are able to relate to things that are accredited,” she said. Accreditation provides the arboretum and the campus with both a sustainability benchmark and a third party endorsement. This is beneficial for applying to grants and maintaining an overall sense of validity, she said.  "

        "Content": "Lisa Alexander, the Department of Resident Life’s Program Manager for Sustainability Programs and Initiatives, established both the Green Terp program and the Terp to Terp Campus ReUse Store — two influential programs for engaging students with sustainability. Alexander launched the Green Terp program in collaboration with the Office of Sustainability in 2016 to promote activities, events and behaviors that align with being a “green,” or environmentally conscious, Terp. The program evolved from prior initiatives, beginning as a checklist of sustainable actions, such as turning off the lights and taking short showers. This transitioned into encouraging students to connect with Green Terp behaviors throughout the entirety of their college career, as opposed to individual actions. The Terp to Terp Campus ReUse store also focuses on students — both involving them in sustainability and providing free essential needs. Alexander modeled the store after a “trash to treasure” program from Penn State, her Alma Mater. Terp to Terp, established in 2021, collects donations of gently used clothing, dorm essentials, and small appliances, and allows students to schedule appointments to take what they need. The program also uses their social media presence to promote waste prevention. Alexander believes the two programs show students how their actions interact with the environment. “I’m hoping it’s creating a culture of social responsibility, where people can think about how their involvement with the world works, what they purchase and buy, and what that then looks like in the process of waste,” she said. Alexander says the goal of the programs is to provide out-of-class experience that can “mirror” what they are learning in the classroom.  "

When James was the Director of the Environmental Science and Policy program, two students in the  department approached him with the idea, saying,  “We want this minor, and you can’t give us no for an answer.” After the students brought the idea to the Provost, James began working on developing the minor within a matter of months — even putting together the required introductory sustainability course in about a month. The program gained traction fast, with about 150 students signing up in a week. James’ intention with the course was to show students that sustainability was “not just recycling.” He brought together environmental science, economics, culture and social issues to give students the groundwork of what sustainability really is.  James wanted the minor to be applicable to all majors and allow students to tailor their courses to complement their major. He received support from different departments on campus, as well as positive student feedback. He hopes that the minor can help students differentiate themselves when applying to jobs and use the minor as an “academic badge that could carry [them] along.” "

The program recently received a grant from the University Sustainability Fund to hire an undergraduate researcher to delve into ways the curriculum can be updated to facilitate growth, Goger said. They plan to research other universities’ sustainability programs and what qualities employers look for to encourage practical skills that can progress their careers. “Almost every course on campus has some aspects of sustainability, so we really want to make sure that our minor is up to date and addressing the needs of students,” Goger said.  The minor currently has students from 80 different majors, with the most popular colleges being Engineering, Behavior and Social Sciences, Architecture, Business, and Computer, Mathematical and Natural Sciences, Goger said. She believes the minor provides Maryland students with a sustainability lens and knowledge of principles that they can apply to their future career.  "

        "Content": "Students at the University of Maryland'sTerrapin Workslabs are hard at work, operating heavy machinery and intricate software, sporting lab goggles and protective gear, and working towards a future of engineering that reduces waste. Just a short walk away, students enrolled in Introduction to Engineering Design (ENES100) are turning reused screws, wheels and batteries to make a mobile class project, utilizing the initiative in which their course leaders engineered a new spin on practical waste reduction. Terrapin Works, a makerspace whose lab facilities span across 16 UMD buildings, is run primarily by 100 student employees who fulfill manufacturing orders for the university and educate their peers about the labs’ machinery. The lab is the Technical Operations Unit within the Engineering Information Technology subsection of the A. James Clark School of Engineering. Their work consists of making prototypes and utilizing advanced manufacturing and digital design resources, according to Terrapin Work’s website. Workers are skilled in 3D printing, creating anything from plastic pumpkins to machine parts–their 3D printed Testudos are commonly found at club fairs and events around campus. With the intention of promoting the reuse of materials within makerspaces on campus, David Kriesberg, manager of Terrapin Work’s Instructional Fabrication Lab, worked with a team to create a polylactic acid (PLA) mold that allows students to melt down pre-used plastic to create a PLA sheet, which is used by ENES100 for a class project. ENES100includes a project where students design and build a remote-controlled rover that has to complete tasks, such as navigate an obstacle course or pick up objects. Students are provided with plywood or acrylic sheets to build their rover, but are incentivized with extra time on the final presentation of their project to instead use a recycled PLA sheet. Students who choose to use the PLA sheet go to the Instructional Fabrication Lab and learn how to create the sheet themselves. One of Terrapin Works’ goals for the project is to efficiently create PLA sheets for all sections of ENES100 to use, which is roughly two sheets per team for about 14 sections. Each section has five teams of eight students. When first making PLA sheets, lab workers placed recycled granulated plastic on a mold, a baking sheet, and melted it down in a toaster oven. Lab workers weighed the granulated plastic to determine the density and thickness of the sheet. The process took two to three hours for one sheet. The sheets were often bumpy and the process was inefficient, prompting the design team to strategize a way to enhance the process. With support from the Sustainability Fund, Terrapin Works purchased a new oven that accelerates the production process and improves temperature control. The new oven and manufactured molds cut down production time from about two hours to only thirty minutes per sheet, and allows four sheets to be produced at the same time. Ideally, Terrapin Works staff will produce the PLA sheets for ENES100 over summer and winter breaks to be ready for students by the fall and spring semesters. “We’re still working through the process,” said Kriesberg. “We’ve designed an experiment that calculates different time ranges versus temperatures to try to get the sweet spot of what would be the fastest and flattest that we can get [the PLA sheet.]” Kriesberg hopes to create a loop system where plastic waste, such as failed 3D prints, is collected from makerspaces to use for production of PLA sheets, which can be used again by the makerspaces once the PLA sheets are formed. He also hopes that students will use materials provided by Terrapin Works as opposed to buying from websites such as Amazon. The mold will be usable by other makerspaces on campus that have similar equipment, like 3D printers. An estimated 160 pounds of PLA waste will be recycled yearly with the use of the new oven and molds, as well as create an efficient waste collection process, or a “campus-wide recycling network,” according to the Sustainability Fund proposal. The process is an opportunity for students to develop sustainability skills and for instructors to incorporate sustainability into their curriculum. Project leaders hope to engage a wider audience in plastic recycling and to have positive environmental effects that spread to other communities, according to their proposal. In combination with the use of the PLA sheets, the ENES100 School Store is making further strides to reduce waste by creating a space where ENES100 students can donate used project materials and make them available for future students. Before the school store was created, the program made kits for the rovers that students could borrow and return at the end of the project, but students still had to buy other materials, such as sensors, gears etc. This totaled to about forty dollars per student, and many of the materials used were discarded at the end of the course, according to the project's Sustainability Fund proposal, authored by ENES100 instructor and school store project advisor Michael Galczynski. The school store was designed to provide students with materials used in previous semesters that were not provided in the kits, and to create a reuse cycle of materials for the rover project, such as electric motors and voltage regulators. Additionally, parts are more accessible to students, as they do not have to order a new one if, for example, sand got stuck in their rover’s motor, explained Galcyznski. The Sustainability Fund provided a grant to cover materials costs for building the school store and a system for keeping track of items. The store is neatly organized with separate containers for each type of material and barcodes for students to scan when they take an item. Students are given a budget of 50 coins to spend at the store to ensure that there are enough materials for all teams to use and to facilitate creative substitutes for certain materials, according to Galczynski. The project aims to reduce carbon emissions from production and shipping of materials, and reduce waste from packaging. Students gain hands-on experience with sustainability principles and the importance of recycling materials through the practical implications of the school store. Both students and the overall program save money by choosing the sustainable option of recycling parts. The school store and Terrapin Work’s PLA mold project have plans to expand beyond their current reaches and involve more students, staff and faculty in their recycling and waste conscious efforts. Further educating students on the principles of sustainability and the importance of reducing waste makes for a hopeful future of production, and of future Terp engineers. "

In 2021, the Office of Sustainability received funding to create a mobile outreach center, now known as theSustainableUMD Outreach Bike. A new tool for engagement in the Office of Sustainability, the Outreach Bike adds mobility and addresses one of the grand challenges on our campus: sustainability and climate action. As part of the Office of Sustainability’s Earth Month 2023 programming, campus events are encouraged to highlight their connections to theUnited Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The SDGs are a framework adopted by the United Nations (UN) member states in 2015 that pave the way for just and equitable societies. Aside from member states, various businesses, universities, and nonprofits rely on the goals to relate their work to sustainability and show the strides they are making for global sustainability development. The SDGs recognize that sustainability solutions come from partnerships and collaborations across industries. Throughout the University of Maryland (UMD), many initiatives connect to the SDGs such as courses,research opportunities, andoperations programs. For more information on SDGs at UMD, visit theSustainableUMD Progress Hub. "

With the support of a $45,000 grant from the Sustainability Fund, the Office of Sustainability is piloting an expanded outreach program which includes seven paid internships, more than a dozen Sustainability Ambassadors, and a focus on empowering students as peer-educators. The grant will support the development of in-depth training, leadership, professional development, and service learning for students engaged with sustainability on campus. \"We expect these programs to enhance the student experience by providing more access to data, knowledge, and information regarding campus sustainability accomplishments, barriers, challenges, and goals,\" said Taylor Brinks, an associate in the Office of Sustainability. By directly involving students in developing new approaches, UMD can continue to build a culture of sustainability where students gain first-hand experience and outreach programming stays fresh and relevant. The previous award cycle funded a landmark 35 paid undergraduate student opportunities in sustainability for the 2022-2023 academic year. These positions were created by eight grants that received around $200,000 from the Sustainability Fund. In addition to the expanded outreach pilot, the Fund awarded grants to four research projects, the Terp to Terp Campus ReStore, production of a podcast about solutions, and a new pilot to increase local, plant-based food options in the Dining Halls.

Reiterating Jeffries’ comments, Sabrina LaBold added: “We like to see any projects that are exciting and new.” LaBold will lead the student-majority Sustainability Fund Review Committee in the upcoming academic year. Students can apply to join the SFRC until September 13, 2022.  The Sustainability Fund is celebrating another major milestone in 2022 -- the first fee increase since the Fund’s inception in 2010. The student sustainability fee accounts for roughly 1% of the annual fees paid by students. The Sustainability Fund allocates all of the revenue from this fee to grant proposals reviewed by a student-led, student-majority review committee and approved by the University Sustainability Council on an annual basis. With the fee increase, the Fund will have more than $400,000 available to distribute in the 2022-2023 award cycle. All UMD students, staff, and faculty are eligible to apply by the priority deadline on October 15th or by January 15th. "

The people who live, work and study here are part of the story of this place. The blend of natural and man-made elements that comprise the campus-city landscape are the setting for that story and shape its possibilities. Over time, all of the living and designed elements of a landscape contribute to its future. We, collectively, have the obligation and opportunity to choose how we want that future to look.  Since sustainability is--in essence--about the future, thoughtful planning is an essential piece of creating a story that achieves the kind of visions embodied in campus, community, and global sustainability goals.

        "Content": "Greater College Park is undergoing a historic transformation with sustainability and smart growth as guiding principles. With a vision of creating a thriving community having a balanced mix of housing, education, research, and amenities, the University of Maryland is in partnership with governments and businesses to transform the community. Projects including the Purple Line and the Baltimore Avenue Redevelopment further this vision by making mass transit and micro-mobility (including bikes, scooters, skateboards, etc.) preferred options for traveling across the campus, city, and region. An expanding network of electric vehicle charging stations are making it easier for those driving zero emissions vehicles. Tens of thousands of solar panels cover roofs on campus and on homes and businesses citywide, helping to make College Park a Green Power Community.  Smart growth development principles include an eye toward environmental stewardship and reducing an area’s environmental footprint. With a reduced reliance on combustion-powered single occupancy vehicles, air quality is improved and when redevelopment replaces older facilities, water quality is improved. Almost all buildings constructed on campus for the last two decades and almost all buildings currently under construction on campus and in Greater College Park are built on former parking lots or other sites that were developed prior to stormwater control regulations. Today, all new construction is required to meet stringent standards that require capture and treatment of stormwater, which protects human communities and aquatic ecosystems downstream. New construction is also required to meet strict energy and environmental performance standards, either through Prince George’s County or the university. For instance, all new UMD buildings need to exceed current energy code, meet at least LEED Silver green building standards, and comply with the university’s Carbon Neutral New Development Initiative.  The interactive map provided through the first button below highlights the many projects that have been built and/or planned. Taken as a whole, Greater College Park is increasingly becoming a hub for sustainability, innovation, entrepreneurship, and entertainment.  It is a place where people want to live, work, play, and stay to create solutions to the world’s most vexing problems. "

        "Content": "The Campus Creek is undergoing careful restoration after many years of destabilizing impacts from urban flooding and associated erosion. UMD is returning the creek to a healthy state that can support a biodiverse aquatic community and better contribute to the ecological health of the Anacostia River and the Chesapeake Bay downstream. In collaboration with the Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR), engineers and project managers in UMD’s Department of Facilities Management worked with stream restoration and forestry experts to design and  repair the creek’s embankments, promote floodplain reconnection and restore natural stream function. The design approach for the first phase of this project (completed in 2019) also focused on minimizing tree impacts, disturbance and improving the health of the forested ecosystem that lines the creek’s banks on the northern end of UMD’s campus.  Stream restoration design principles recognize that the biology and physicochemical properties of a healthy stream rely on underlying physical structures. These structures allow water to be transported with appropriate flow and energy and create diverse substrates for habitat and chemical processes that break down pollution. The structures are the main focus of the restoration process because they determine the stream’s geomorphology, hydraulics, and hydrology which are the foundation of healthy aquatic chemistry and ecology.  Healthy streams and rivers provide an array of environmental, social and economic benefits that also improve the communities around them, including the mitigation of area flooding and improvement of recreational opportunities. It is hoped that students, faculty, staff and visitors will enjoy the Campus Creek’s renewed state. Currently, UMD is working with a number of partners including the Chesapeake Bay Trust and Maryland DNR to fund and develop a second restoration phase for Campus Creek.   "

        "Content": "As of 2020, all electricity delivered to campus by regional power plants comes from renewable sources. Extensive building energy efficiency retrofits, engagement in energy conservation, and more than 9,000 solar panels on campus have all contributed to UMD's progress on reducing its carbon footprint by 56% since 2005. Remaining carbon emissions associated with power result from fossil fuels for on-campus energy systems. To generate most power for the main campus, UMD uses natural gas-fired turbines that produce the bulk of electric energy for the university. The heat that these turbines give off, rather than being lost, is then captured in a heat recovery system to produce and process steam for heating the campus. The recovered steam is also utilized to generate additional electric power and to drive chillers that provide cooling to campus. This \"trigeneration\" system, originally installed in 1999, is approaching the end of its life. In order to upgrade the existing system while meeting our sustainability goals, the university conducted extensive research and evaluated a range of options for generating cooling, heating and power on campus moving forward.  The resulting NextGen energy infrastructure program builds on the university’s environmental commitment and supports efforts, immediately and in the future, to achieve carbon neutrality. The program is highly adaptable, allowing the University of Maryland to incorporate the new, high-efficiency technologies of today while providing flexibility to utilize the technologies of tomorrow.

        "Content": "Feature Article for 2021-2022, by Emily Hightower With over 5,000 acres of land across the state of Maryland, the University of Maryland College Park’s campuses are abundant in natural spaces and forested areas. The main campus in College Park is an internationally accredited arboretum with over 15,000 trees, more than 60 acres of protected forest easement, and an Audubon Certified Sanctuary Golf Course. Satellite campuses around the state include over 2,500 acres of farmland, agricultural research stations, fire safety and training facilities, and a bioscience research complex.  These green spaces provide important benefits to mental and physical health, education, and campus operations. They provide enormous environmental benefits ranging from storm protection to energy conservation, from wildlife sanctuaries to carbon storage. As part of the University’s 2015 Climate Action Plan, the university committed to studying these natural landscapes to better understand the carbon sequestered and stored by forests on campus. Forests⁠—and the carbon they sequester as part of the natural carbon cycle⁠—were a primary focus of the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference. In the Glasgow Leaders’ Declaration on Forest and Land Use, more than 141 countries pledged to a sustainable land use transition, committing to halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation, conserve coastal wetlands and peatlands, and generally conserve global ecosystems and biodiversity.

The ED model projects the growth of existing trees and the carbon provided by newly planted trees and is based on research by UMD faculty and staff in the Department of Geographical Sciences. Field data from the US Forest Service and the UMD Arboretum and Botanical Gardens verifies the campus forest carbon estimates derived from the student methodology. After generating and verifying the data, the student methodology plots ABG gains and losses on UMD land property maps, capturing forest carbon flux in aggregate and by location which allows analysis of major gains and losses by property. The student methodology was established by leveraging efforts by UMD researchers and NASA-CMS scientists to calculate forest carbon sequestration, storage, and potential for the State of Maryland greenhouse gas emissions inventory. The data generated by the student team will provide a subset of the State of Maryland's total forest carbon flux, data specific to the forests on University of Maryland properties. The student researcher team has included more than ten students over the span of the project. Their contributions include research; data collection and organization; modeling; GIS-analysis; data visualization; peer-verified carbon offset protocol development; and a variety of other tasks. Equipped with invaluable skills developed through the experiential project, students that joined as juniors and seniors in the first year of the project have graduated to careers such as Environmental Impact Manager at a reforestation company and GIS Analyst at USDA. Others have pursued graduate degrees in geographical sciences and medical geography. Current undergraduate students involved in the project have also become involved with the Sustainability Fund Student Review Committee, the Student Government Association Sustainability Committee, and other notable groups on campus. The project’s first graduate assistant was awarded the Maryland Sea Grant State Science Policy Fellowship at the Maryland Department of the Environment after receiving a doctorate from UMD. The following graduate assistants previously worked on the project as undergraduates and pursued Masters of Science in Geographical Sciences at UMD. All are working with nonprofits, researchers, and politicians to help shape the future of forest carbon monitoring at local, state, national, and international levels. Throughout the project, the students have developed materials for other students, technical experts, and the general public.

UMD is the first university in the nation to use remote-sensing data to calculate campus forest carbon flux for its greenhouse gas emissions inventory. Using the same technologies, data, and models as the State of Maryland and international communities, these students have identified trends in campus forest carbon activities. They have identified opportunities to increase carbon sequestration on campus through planting and management and determined the cause of carbon disturbances. Overall, they found that campus is a carbon sink -- it absorbs more carbon through forests than what is lost due to tree removal or disturbance. Moving forward, the university plans to include these calculations in the greenhouse gas emission inventory annually. UMD will also explore how to incorporate carbon storage potential and relevant strategies into the climate action plan.

Another subset of the project focuses on making this methodology available to other universities for peer-reviewed offset verification. While these offsets would only apply to Scope 3 emissions, the peer verification process is far less time and cost intensive. This would allow local small land owners the opportunity to explore the feasibility of reforestation in their area in partnership with local colleges and universities to offset commuting and air travel emissions.

Through a combination of sustainability measures and the strategic purchase of carbon credits, UMD will reach this goal by Earth Day in 2025. In addition, I am proud to announce plans to replace our university-owned fleet - over 1,070 fossil-fuel vehicles - with an all-electric fleet by 2035.” — President Pines, Apr 21, 2021 President Pines' commitments build on the initial 2050 carbon neutrality deadline established by Presidents Mote and Loh. Since the first Climate Action Plan in 2009, UMD has achieved a 62% reduction in net greenhouse gas emissions. The video in the first button below captures UMD’s historic sustainability commitments and progress while introducing the next chapter of sustainability at UMD. For the first time, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has listed humans as the cause for climate change, stating: “It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land. Widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere have occurred. Human-induced climate change is already affecting many weather and climate extremes in every region across the globe” (Sixth Assessment Report, Aug. 9, 2021). By working together as one community, SustainableUMD has the power to make a real impact in helping humanity meet the IPCC climate targets.

Starting as an agricultural college, UMD has evolved over the years to include thirteen School and Colleges with graduate and undergraduate learning opportunities. As of Spring 2020, more than 26.5% of UMD’s courses include sustainability content and all Schools and Colleges offer sustainability-related courses or degree programs. UMD's curriculum has direct connections to internationally agreed upon sustainability goals. In 2015, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at its core. These SDGs are “an urgent call for action by all countries in a global partnership,” providing “a shared blueprint for peace and the planet, now and into the future.” The SDGs are interlinked, recognizing that ending poverty is tied to improved health and education, that reducing inequality spurs economic growth, and importantly that all of these goals impact climate change and are essential to protecting and preserving our environment (United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, 2021). Using the UN SDGs as an educational framework, UMD's programs place content and skills learning in a global context, providing students the opportunity to study and solve real-world problems. "

The study brings together students from the School of Information Studies with researchers from the School of Architecture, Planning, and Preservation to study real-time stormwater runoff. The data will allow campus operators to understand how UMD’s stormwater systems manage normal and extreme weather events while also providing opportunities to explore Internet of Things technologies, the impact of infrastructure on society, and the benefits of stormwater management systems on water quality. An increasing number of organizations are integrating the SDGs into events, conferences, case studies, and other programs.

In June 2021, the Jones-Hill House became the second carbon neutral space on campus after the Brendan Iribe Center for Computer Science and Engineering. The 340,000 square foot facility offers athletic, research, and entrepreneurship space. With the opening of the Pyon-Chen residence hall in Fall 2021, an additional 450 beds increased total on-campus housing to over 9,300 beds. This serves around 32% of UMD’s undergraduate population and almost three times the number of incoming first-year students. Additional near-to-campus housing is increasing due to development around the Purple Line. Creating on-campus and near-to-campus housing encourages pedestrian modes of transportation, reducing emissions from single-use occupancy vehicles and easing access to campus. A new project to upgrade Baltimore Avenue began in June 2020 to increase pedestrian safety along Route 1. The three year, $29 million project was sponsored by the Maryland Department of Transportation and will address 1.4 miles from Regents Drive to University Boulevard. Upgrades will include: Looking to the future, the University will implement the NextGen Energy Program, create infrastructure to support a zero emissions vehicle fleet, and plans to open a number of sustainable buildings. These include the Johnson-Whittle residence hall, the Yahentamitsi dining facility, the IDEA Factory, and the new School of Public Policy among others. "

Through a Department of Resident Life pilot program called Terp to Terp ReUse Store, the Campus Pantry also has a limited selection of cooking supplies to donate which were recovered during DRL’s Move Out Donation Drive program. While meeting increased demand during 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Pantry served more than 8,000 UMD community members over 100,000 pounds of food. Over 1,200 students committed to make sustainable choices with the Green Terp Program. The Office of Sustainability collaborated with departments around campus to hold virtual events as part of the monthly Green Terp Dialogue Series exploring topics like waste, transportation, food, and energy. Over 300 students participated in exploring why these issues matter, what the campus is doing to address them, and how they can take action as individuals. With campus transitioning back to normal operations, Green Terps are at events including the Farmer’s Market, FreeFest, and others. In 2020, the Office of Sustainability partnered with the Academy for Innovation and Entrepreneurship to host a sustainability-centered design thinking workshop. More than 60 students participated, including students from the College Park Scholars ETE Program, the Sustainability Cooperative (SCoop), and Green Terp Ambassadors. The Green Terp program and Office of Sustainability aim to continue partnering across campus to create unique sustainability-related skills development opportunities.     "

        "Content": "It’s an unseasonably warm Saturday morning in October at 10 AM. Most UMD students are still asleep, but a dedicated group of student volunteers already have their hands in the dirt of the campus Community Learning Garden. Work hours are hosted on Mondays, Thursdays, and Saturdays at the garden. Meg Smolinski, the Outreach Coordinator for the UMD Arboretum and Botanical Gardens, often facilitates these hours. “If you come to a work hour, you’re gonna get your hands dirty,” Smolinski said. Planted next to the School of Public Health in 2010, the Community Learning Garden is a student-created, student-run teaching and learning garden partially funded by the University Sustainability Fund. Depending on the season, the garden grows everything from summer squash, cucumbers, basil, tomatoes, and more. The garden serves as an educational resource for students to learn about sustainable agriculture techniques and as an outlet to help alleviate food insecurity on campus. Amanda Sames, a recent graduate of UMD, was active in the garden for much of her college career and served as the group’s president from 2021-2023. During her fall term as president, Sames noticed that the garden's raised beds were in poor condition. With part of the garden located on a steep slope between Eppley Recreation Center and the School of Public Health, the raised bed area had long provided an accessible portion of the garden to some campus community members who require accessibility accommodations. As the staff and students that coordinate the CLG wanted to preserve the portion of the garden that was accessible to all, they sought to improve this area with the Sustainability Fund grant. In 2022, Sames applied to the Sustainability Fund and was awarded $30,000 to rebuild the Community Learning Garden’s raised beds. The new raised beds were built during this past summer. They are located on a flat stretch of land at the top of the garden, which has revamped the portion of the garden that is accessible to most. “We would not have had the funds to rebuild these beds without the Sustainability Fund grant,” Smolinski said. She added that the Sustainability Fund has long played a crucial role in the garden and their efforts to alleviate food insecurity on campus.  "

However, food insecurity significantly increased on campus with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. “Before the pandemic there were about 70 visitors a week to the Campus Pantry, during the height of the pandemic that number shot up to 400,” Smolinski said. From that point on, the Community Learning Garden has committed to donating one-hundred percent of their harvest to the Campus Pantry. Passion for this mission to relieve food insecurity in the campus community is shared by members of the garden’s student group. “Being able to donate everything we have to the food pantry where any [student, staff, or faculty] is allowed to come in and get free food, that’s super important to me,” says Grace Walsh-Little, the group’s current president.  These new raised beds should last about 25 years. “The raised beds we have now, the difference between them is insane,” Walsh-Little said. Right now, the new beds are filled with a cover crop but in January the student group will host their seed picking event. During this event, club members get to sort through a catalog and pick out which crops they want to plant in the brand-new raised beds. If you have any questions about the Community Learning Garden or are interested in getting involved in the student group, please contact Meg Smolinksi: msmolins@umd.edu.  "

The Office of Sustainability participated by putting together an upcycled keychain-making event at theOutreach Bikeand had a succulent giveaway for students who participated in taking a survey. The survey was curated as a way to gauge sustainable involvement on campus and with the office. EarthFest was a hit as the Office of Sustainability saw just about 400 students between both activities.

As part of the Office of Sustainability’s Green Chapter program, fraternities and sororities at the University of Maryland are given the opportunity to participate in the annual dumpster painting event, which is sponsored by Facilities Management- Recycling and Solid Waste. Between April 6th and April 14th, 11 chapters across the four councils of the Department of Fraternity and Sorority Life took part in this activity. Each chapter’s Sustainability Chair planned out a creative design revolving around recycling. Then, with the help of their chapter members, they made their ideas a reality! Over the course of the week, students dropped by the Graham Cracker parking lot to beautify three recycling dumpsters. Each eye-catching design is meant to encourage members of the campus community to properly sort their waste. This event is a great way for students to mix art with advocacy. Be on the lookout around campus for the 2024 dumpster designs. "

At the Kick-Off, students, staff, and faculty members answered a bike safety trivia question to receive a free helmet at the DOTS tent. For instance, did you know that on campus the speed limit for all forms of transportation is 20 miles per hour? The Smoothie Bike made an appearance at theFarmers Market. Students pedaled to blend their berry-filled smoothies. At theSustainableUMD Outreach Bike, students pledged to become Green Terps. By registering a bike or scooter on campus, students are one step closer to certifying as a Green Terp and earning their reusable prize. Did you miss Bike Week 2023?

There is plenty of opportunity for every person on campus to contribute toward reaching these goals!

The more people who choose carpooling, vanpooling, public transit, walking, or biking as a means of getting from one place to another, the greater those reductions will be. New housing projects located throughout College Park will increase options for living where you work/study.

To address the environmental impact of this travel, the university will implement a carbon offset program to negate 100% of the carbon emissions associated with air travel starting in 2018. A Carbon Offset Fund Committee reporting to the University Sustainability Council will select verified projects that sequester or prevent carbon emissions and determine the best process for administering the program.

        "Header": "What is Climate Justice?",
        "Content": "Climate justice seeks to address the root causes of climate change while simultaneously tackling various social, racial, and environmental injustices (MIT Climate Portal, 2022). It acknowledges that climate change disproportionately affects low-income communities and communities of color. Central to climate justice is the concept of a just transition, which involves moving from fossil fuel-based economies to equitable, renewable energy-based systems; emphasizing sustainable practices; and instituting broad economic changes. It advocates for the fair distribution of both the benefits from activities causing climate change and the burdens of its impacts. Climate justice also emphasizes inclusive decision-making, prioritizing those most affected by climate change, and recognizing the threat it poses to basic human rights (University of California Center for Climate Justice, 2022). While both climate justice and environmental justice (EJ) seek to address inequities in environmental impacts and decision-making, they operate at different scales and focus on different aspects of environmental challenges. For example, EJ primarily deals with local and regional environmental issues, such as pollution and access to clean resources, whereas climate justice addresses the global impacts of climate change, emphasizing how climate change exacerbates social, racial, and economic inequalities. Moreover, EJ has roots in the civil rights movement and addresses a wide range of environmental harms beyond just climate change. Climate justice emerged more recently as awareness of the intersections between discrimination and the global climate crisis became more prominent. Climate justice focuses on ensuring that the impacts of climate action are distributed fairly and that vulnerable communities are supported in adaptation efforts. Both movements are crucial for achieving a comprehensive approach to addressing environmental and climate-related challenges (Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy, 2022). "
