Higher education institutions, such as the University of Maryland, are in a unique position to advance sustainability solutions, awareness, and action. Over 50,000 students, faculty and staff live, work, research and study on campus each day. From energy and water use to transportation and food services, UMD has continual opportunities to cultivate a culture of sustainability while conducting critical research that guides sustainability policy and innovation here and around the world. UMD strives to empower students, faculty and staff to take sustainable steps by bringing local and global systems into balance, redesigning processes to conserve resources, and experimenting with novel sustainable practices. We recognize the power of higher education to influence broader change, empower youth with skills and understanding, and integrate change by serving as an immersive learning lab for education, research, experience and civic engagement. UMD aims to serve as an example for society to facilitate the crucial cultural, functional, and technological transitions to a world that supports everyone. The Office of Sustainability compiles and communicates sustainability efforts from across campus and supports the SustainableUMD network. SustainableUMD refers to the campus-wide commitment to environmental responsibility.  Every person contributes to UMD's impacts and every aspect of campus affects the university's sustainability performance. Regardless of where on campus one works, studies, or lives, each person can help advance sustainability. By integrating academics, research, operations, and student engagement, the campus community can model and leverage broader change. Within the campus, UMD is innovating sustainable solutions, immersing students in a healthy and inspiring environment, and modeling a demonstration for more green communities. \nSite Title: About | SustainableUMD\nHeader: SustainableUMD\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/about"

The department generally aims to prevent stormwater pollution, partnering with UMD’s Facilities Management, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, and Maryland Department of the Environment to protect the region’s waterways. Stormwater Facilities: UMD’s Facilities Management designs and implements projects to mitigate the impact of new development— for example, buildings and new paved areas— on our watershed and local waterways. When areas are paved over, water flows away quickly, allowing it to absorb into the ecosystem. This causes erosion, flash flooding, nutrient overloading in water systems, and generally murky, polluted waters. The campus has invested in many projects that reduce water consumption and manage stormwater to prevent watershed pollution, including: Water Conservation: UMD is one of the largest consumers of potable water in the State, so water conservation is essential to reduce utility costs and minimize stress on regional infrastructure. By adopting water-efficient operations, appliances, and equipment, departments across campus are working to reduce their potable water consumption. The campus has invested in efficient updates such as low-flow toilets, showers, faucets, and moisture sensors on irrigated fields. These efforts have reduced water consumption over the last decade compared to growth in campus population and buildings. \nSite Title: Water | SustainableUMD\nHeader: \nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/water"

        "Content": "UMD's Campus Creek restoration project took place in November 2019 and helped slow stormwater runoff and erosion through native plantings, step pools, and floodplains that mimic wetlands. The Campus Creek restoration project, designed to address stormwater runoff and erosion within the creek, was completed in November 2019 by UMD Facilities Management. After 10 years of planning, the project was funded in large part by grants from Maryland Department of Natural Resources and the UMD Sustainability Fund. The project restored over 3,000 feet of the creek starting behind Oakland Hall and extending to the east side of the School of Public Health. As part of this effort, over 700 native species of trees were planted within the creek corridor.  A series of step pools were created to slow the water’s movement through the creek bed, preventing erosion using a technique known as Regenerative Stream Conveyance (RSC). These pools slow the water flowing through the creek, reducing flooding, erosion and sedimentation. This reduces nutrient overloading and lessens muddiness in the water. In certain parts of the stream, water flows into flood plains during heavy rain, mimicking naturally occurring wetland habitats found in the area. The flood plains are low-lying, shallow areas adjacent to the creek, designed to receive water during heavy rains then recede. This wet/dry cycle creates a unique habitat that sustains the life of a number of native plants and animals.  Over 400 acres of campus drains into the restored section of the creek, and the restoration replaced 105 acres of paved (or impervious) area. Of the 1,340 acres of the UMD campus, 454 acres are impervious such as roadways, parking lots, rooftops, and sidewalks. These impervious areas prevent stormwater from soaking into the ground, rather creating runoff that spurs erosion, pollution, and harms the health of our waterways and the species that call them home. Stormwater regulations require the University to treat at least 20% of our existing impervious area, which equals approximately 91 acres. With the Campus Creek Restoration, UMD went well beyond the requirement for impervious runoff treatment. Learn more from the UMD Arboretum and see before and after pictures of the Campus Creek on the Progress Hub.

        "Content": "Over the years, Paint Branch has exhibited many problems typically associated with urban streams. This is often due to increased urban runoff and loss of adjacent forest and wetlands (riparian habitat), among other reasons. Ultimately, the stream changes, resulting in fish blockages, lack of aquatic habitat, and poor water quality. The Paint Branch Fish Passage and Stream Restoration Project was a large stream restoration project in which the US Army Corps of Engineers partnered with Prince George's County Department of Environmental Resources, Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, and the University of Maryland to restore approximately one mile of Paint Branch. Note that this reach of Paint Branch was very important as it connects to other recently completed stream restoration projects, thereby creating a long reach of Paint Branch that has been restored. The project area is located in the southern portion of the Anacostia River sub-watershed and starts where Paint Branch goes under State Route 193 (University Boulevard/Greenbelt Road) to the north and ends where Paint Branch goes under U.S. Route 1 (Baltimore Avenue) to the south, including several hundred linear feet where the stream is within the northeastern district of the university. The goal of the project is to create a stable stream condition and provide habitat for resident and migratory aquatic resources. The project addresses known fish blockages in Paint Branch and provides additional spawning habitat for river herring. Most of the work within the university was completed from 2012 through 2014, with work continuing upstream towards U.S. Route 1 in 2014.  \nSite Title: Water Initiatives | SustainableUMD\nHeader: Paint Branch Restoration\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/topics/water/water-initiatives"

As a university, we can reduce our food footprint through intentionally sourcing locally grown food that is sustainably grown and minimizing food waste.  Cool Food Pledge: In August 2019, the University of Maryland became the first university signatory of the World Resources Institute Cool Food Pledge, committing Dining Services to slash food-related greenhouse gas emissions 25% below 2017 levels by 2030. Sustainable Food Commitment: UMD Dining Services surpassed their target of 20% sustainable food before the 2020 target. GHG emissions per plate were reduced 14.4% in 2022 compared to the previous year. Menus of Change: UMD Dining is a member of the Menus of Change University Research Collaborative. This network of over 65 universities, research centers, and other organizations is accelerating efforts to move people toward healthier, more sustainable, and delicious foods using evidence-based research, education, and innovation. UMD’s Ocean Friendly Campus Initiative: Dining replaced approximately 1.3 million plastic items from campus annually including bags, utensils, and straws, and provided reusable bags to all 9,000 Anytime Dining plan members.

        "Content": "Criteria for ProposalsThe Sustainability Fund Review Committee will evaluate proposals based on the following criteria.REQUIREDCampus Affiliation - Only UMD students, staff members, and/or faculty members can propose projects. Individual students or student organizations proposing a project must include the name and contact information for a faculty or staff sponsor/advisor who is committed to advising throughout the project implementation. All proposers must include the name and contact information for a business officer who will oversee the use of funds for the project.Minimum Request - The proposer requests no less than $2,000 and no more than the total amount available in the Sustainability Fund.Proposers seeking less than $2,000 can request a Sustainability Mini Grant from the Student Government Association’s Sustainability Committee.Itemized Budget and Schedule - The proposer must submit an itemized budget that details the full cost of implementing the project and specifies the budget items for which the proposer is seeking Sustainability Fund support. The proposer must also provide an appropriate schedule for completing the project.Metrics and Reporting - The proposal includes a plan for tracking, recording, and reporting the project outcomes back to the Fund Coordinator within 12 months of receiving funding.PREFERREDInnovation - The project is innovative and does not include routine maintenance/equipment replacement or code-compliant activities. The Fund may provide money to cover the cost difference between conventional equipment and/or operations and sustainable alternatives.Project Outcomes - Sustainability Fund projects typically meet at least one of the following criteria and ideally meet multiple criteria in this section, however, projects that do not meet these criteria may be considered.Please contact the Fund Coordinator prior to applying if your project does not match with one of the following:The project improves the environmental performance of campus operations by decreasing greenhouse gas emissions, reducing energy and/or water use, enhancing stormwater management, increasing biodiversity, minimizing waste, etc.The project substantially improves or creates opportunities for UMD students to learn about and develop skills for sustainability or otherwise enhances the UMD student experience.The project involves research that would create substantial opportunities for student involvement and the outcomes of the research have practical implications for improving the environmental performance of campus operations.Appropriate Expenses - The proposer requests Sustainability Fund money to cover the costs for materials and/or skilled labor to implement the project and not salaries or stipends. Furthermore, Fund money would cover only one-time costs and not ongoing costs.Feasibility and Institutional Support - The project is feasible and has the support/approval of appropriate campus individuals and units.Cost/Benefit Analysis - The project proposal outlines the payback period (if applicable) and clearly-defined, measurable outcomes, backed by metrics. The benefits will be considered relative to costs and the availability of monies within the Fund.Matching Funds - The sponsoring department or other entities beyond the Sustainability Fund offer matching financial or in-kind support for the project.MULTI-YEAR PROJECTSProjects may be proposed that require multi-year funding for up to 3 calendar years. Projects may include those that require more than 1-year to execute; and/or projects that are ongoing and considered key elements of the campus sustainability program by the Sustainability Fund Review Committee and the Sustainability Council. For multi-year projects, proposers may seek all required funding in one funding cycle or over each of the funding cycles during which the project will be conducted. In their application for the grant, proposers will identify whether they seek lump sum funding in one year or partial funding over each year of the project, as well as the rationale for their request. The committee will recommend funding levels to the University Sustainability Council for its review and approval. For projects approved to receive multi-year funding, the grantee shall annually notify the Office of Sustainability of the project status, and the need for continued funding on a form to be provided.RESEARCH PROJECTSThe Fund may support research projects. The following criteria will be considered when reviewing research project proposals:The proposed work should have a significant promise of having a direct impact on campus. Either the work or the fruits of the work can and will be implemented to make an impact on university sustainability goals (i.e., theoretical, or experimental work that may add to the science would not be considered since it would not be implemented on campus to meet the university's sustainability goals). Since climate change is a global phenomenon, research involving the advancement of climate science may be supported.Applicants should write the grant application in terms of real-world applications and outcomes.All work related to the grant should be performed on UMCP campus, one of its satellite facilities, and/or with extensive involvement of UMCP undergraduate students.The proposer should identify other sources and amounts of funding for the project, including the entities providing the funding.Verifiable letters of support should be provided from people with relevant expertise and not directly involved in the project.The proposed project does not support a dissertation.The committee may determine additional requirements and preferences for each year’s funding cycle provided that these criteria are consistent with the overall mission of the University Sustainability Fund and consistent with the criteria and preferences outlined above.\nSite Title: UMD Sustainability Fund Grant | SustainableUMD\nHeader: What are the criteria for proposals?\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/sustainability-grants/umd-sustainability-fund-grant"

        "Content": "The University of Maryland’s main campus at College Park is a small city with a population of roughly 50,000 with and more than 250 facilities across 1,340 acres. In addition to the College Park campus, UMD also manages over 3,800 acres of land across the state, including facilities in Western Maryland, Eastern Shore, Ellicott City, and Clarksville.  To achieve carbon neutrality by 2025, UMD conserves energy, sources renewable energy, and increases campus efficiency through infrastructure upgrades, green buildings, and smart growth. Carbon Neutrality Initiatives: In 2021, President Pines committed UMD to achieving carbon neutrality by 2025, accelerating UMDs original goal by 25 years. Compared to the 2005 baseline, UMD has already halved greenhouse gas emissions through programs including: the 100% renewable purchased electricity commitment, the Carbon Neutral Air Travel initiative, the Undergraduate Student Commuting Offset Program, and the Carbon Neutral New Development program. Renewable Electricity: As of 2020, all purchased electricity is generated by renewable sources. In addition to the electricity generated on campus by the Combined Heat and Power Plant (30%) and solar panels (5%), around 65% of electricity is sourced from purchasing agreements with local wind and solar farms or from the regional Renewable Energy Credit (REC) market. NextGen Energy Program: The NextGen Energy Program (NextGen) is a major initiative to replace, renew, and modernize the University of Maryland, College Park's aging energy system through a proposed public-private partnership (P3). NextGen plays a critical role in ensuring UMD can depend on a reliable and resilient energy system for decades to come.  Energy Goals & Performance Contracts: UMD and the State of Maryland have encouraged energy efficiency and reduction in energy consumption for the past 15 years. In 2014, UMD committed to the President’s Energy Initiatives which built on existing Climate Action Plan strategies and State of Maryland legislation. Between 2014 and 2020, UMD reduced energy consumption by more than 15%, opened the first carbon neutral building on campus, and established a carbon offset program. \nSite Title: Energy | SustainableUMD\nHeader: \nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/energy"

UMD’s solar arrays are found at the Mowatt, Regents and Terrapin garages, Severn building, and the Institute for Bioscience and Biotechnology Research (IBBR). Since their installation in 2016, the panels are expected to save the university about $1 million during the 20-year contract period, making UMD well positioned to take advantage of the growing cost-effectiveness of renewable energy over fossil fuels.

UMD’s campus is an award-winning arboretum and botanical garden where horticultural staff and volunteers care for trees and gardens, conserve biodiversity, and provide opportunities for education, public enjoyment, research, and food production. Bee Campus USA: In the spring of 2023, the University of Maryland's campus was designated as a Bee Campus USA, recognizing the work of many different campus partners to promote the health of pollinators in our local area through increasing the abundance of native plants, providing nest sites, and reducing the use of pesticides. Prince George's Audubon Society Certified Habitats: Five garden sites on campus were certified PGAS's wildlife habitats in 2023. These gardens include Maryland Natives Shade Garden, Woods Hall Rain Garden, H. Edward Reiley Azalea and Rhododendron Garden, Pollinator Garden at Edward St. John Learning and Teaching Center, and Knight Hall Pollinator Garden. Tree Campus Higher Education: Since the inaugural year of the arboretum in 2008, the University has been honored by the Arbor Day Foundation with the designation of Tree Campus Higher Education. The program provides a framework for colleges and universities to grow their community forests, achieve national recognition, and create a campus their students and staff are proud of. Bird Campus: UMD was recognized as a Bird Campus by the Maryland Bird Conservation Partnership in spring 2024. This recognition signifies UMD's efforts in creating, protecting, and restoring bird habitat, addressing threats to birds,  and engaging people in birding and conservation. ArbNet Level IV Accreditation: UMD achieved the highest level of ArbNet accreditation in 2019. This sucess was made possible through having over 500 labeled tree and woody plant taxa, scientific and conservation staff, substantial public and educational programming, and conservation activities.  Certified Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary: The UMD Golf Course has been recognized as a Audubon Cooperative Sanctuary since 2003. This program promotes ecologically sound land management through environmental planning, wildlife and habitat management, outreach and education, chemical use reduction, water conservation, and water quality management.  \nSite Title: Landscape | SustainableUMD\nHeader: \nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/landscape"

Ask them to brainstorm ways to be more sustainable while saving money. In this time of uncertainty, saving money is more important than ever, so most of the suggestions here can help reduce expenses: What are some sustainable practices that save you money? Here are some suggestions- challenge your household to pick at least 10 options to implement over the next month: Get an electric car for your next vehicle to save on gas Drive less and combine errands when you do.  Bike or walk for trips that are less than 2 miles Drive or train instead of fly for vacations  Wool Dryer Balls cut drying time/energy for laundry by helping separate and air out clothes in the dryer  Wash laundry in cold water saves 90% energy over hot- and preserves colors and fabrics Hang your clothes to dry (this will preserve them as well)  Consider installing a heat pump dryer to save 20%-60% Purchase water efficient fixtures  Place a brick or full jug in your toilet tank to save water Shorter showers (time them using songs/playlists!) Get bulk liquid soap and/or concentrate, and refillable soap dispensers  Choose soap bars and shampoo bars instead of liquids Use reusable safety or electric razor instead of disposable ones Use a menstrual cup instead of disposable tampons/pads Buy white vinegar and baking soda in bulk and make your own cleaning supplies! Buy local produce and eat less meat (especially red meat) Reduce packaging by reusing and buying in bulk Get rid second fridges/freezers (food often gets forgotten/expired there anyway) Switch to an induction stovetop for cooking, instead of a gas range Use reusable and washable rags instead of paper towels! Make your own DIY rags from old/stained/ripped cloths and towels Regrow some of your own produce (surprisingly, a lot of produce can be regrown from the discards! celery, romaine lettuce, chives, etc!) Save and reuse jars from pasta sauce, salsa etc instead of buying tupperware and glasses Use reusable straws, cloth napkins, utensils instead of disposables Use reusable water bottles instead of buying bottled water Select energy-efficient lights like LEDS Invest in energy-saving smart power strips home to reduce energy drain Use thermal insulating curtains and block drafts under exterior doors Set electronics(laptops, computers, printers, etc) to hibernate automatically, putting electronics (TVs, video games etc) that are on 'standby' on a powerstrip and turning it all off so it's not draining unnecessary power, etc, too Lower the heat/ac and dress for the weather instead Get solar water heaters, solar PV panels or geothermal energy to save on electricity (recoup your investment in around 8 years and get savings from then on)  Switch to LED bulbs  Use a programmable thermostat to cut back on heating/cooling  Insulate your furnace and water heater  Get a home energy audit (available for free from Pepco & BGE energy providers!). They will provide swaps for more energy efficient fixtures and make energy saving suggestions for your home. During COVID, these are also offered virtually DIY upcycled crafts for gifts/cards Downsizing the size of your home to something smaller, and in a walkable/bikeable area with public transit Buy used (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, ebay, or thrift stores)  Buy things that will last instead of fast fashion, quick trends, or low-quality things that could break/fall apart easily  Switch from gas to electric (stoves, heaters, etc)  Get clean energy! Even if you can’t afford panels, you can get a PPA, or if you rent, you can pay your energy bill to renewable energy providers Use your balcony or backyard to grow vegetables or plant a pollinator garden Explore and use green landscaping practices for your plants, yard, and trees  care for your trees—make sure you are watering, pruning, and mulching correctly to ensure healthy trees Switch to solar-powered or LED outdoor lighting Trade gas-powered equipment for manual or electric versions Utilize the University of Maryland Extension Home & Garden Information Center's Climate-Resilient Gardening Story Map to find examples of how to adapt your gardens and community green spaces to mitigate and adapt to climate change Listen to the University of Maryland Extension's monthly Garden Thyme Podcast Communicating your values, goals, and intentions with others can inspire them to follow suit! Asking them for their input, advice, and ideas can help motivate them to take action with you. If you live with your family or housemates, it will be easier to implement changes if everyone is part of the process of setting goals, determining strategies, and implementing improvements! Make it a team effort with your household! And, share your list and progress with others too- post to social media, or send a message to a handful of close friends, neighbors, or relatives, about the savings you noticed and how you achieved them! \nSite Title: Green at Home Guide | SustainableUMD\nHeader: Bring Sustainability Home!\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/home"

        "Content": "University research labs deliver crucial innovations that create healthier, better lives for all of us, but they have a dirty little secret—they can consume massive amounts of energy, contributing to climate change. That chemical fume hood that removes unsafe air? It can use as much energy as three average American homes. Toss in a few lab freezers holding a constant -80 degrees Celsius, and energy consumption adds up quickly. A  collaborative effort between the Office of Sustainability and the Department of Engineering & Energy has found ways to reap the benefits of science while reducing the environmental impacts. Called the Green Labs Program, it’s part of UMD’s Climate Action Plan to achieve carbon neutrality on campus, and serves as a resource for labs to identify ways to make research more sustainable. An early participant in the program, cell biology and molecular genetics Professor Norma Andrews, found she was able to eliminate more than 55,000 pounds of annual carbon dioxide emissions by instituting some relatively simple changes. It started with a lab walk-through and presentation to staff by Emery Wolf, UMD Green Labs associate, who talked about energy-saving tactics for the Andrews Lab—which focuses on the cell biology of intracellular protozoan parasites and mechanisms of plasma membrane repair—without impeding research. “We learned a lot from Emery's visit and immediately implemented his suggestions by ‘retiring’ one old -80°C freezer, defrosting refrigerators, adding timers to water baths, and keeping fume hoods closed when not in use,” Andrews said. The hoods, which put an extra load on a building’s HVAC systems when left open, are by far the No. 1 culprit, Wolf said—something most researchers aren’t aware of. They’re often left open even when not needed, flushing heated or air-conditioned air out of the building.  “When ventilation can be reduced, energy is saved, and less carbon is released to the atmosphere,” Wolf said.Charmaine Yuan ‘20, a biological sciences and psychology double major and a sustainability minor, took the sustainability lead for the lab. \"I was so excited when I was invited to serve as a Green Labs change agent and work as a liaison between the Andrews Lab and the Office of Sustainability,” Yuan said. While focused on research goals, it’s easy to leave equipment on and consuming energy, Wolf said.  “There is a real tragedy of the commons that can happen in labs,” he said. \nSite Title: Green Labs | SustainableUMD\nHeader: How One of UMD’s \"Green Labs\" Shed 55,000 Pounds of Greenhouse Gas Emissions\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/get-involved/staff/green-labs"

        "Content": "The first step to going green at home is talking to those you live with: your roommates, housemates, your family, or whoever impacts your home decisions.  Ask them to brainstorm ways to be more sustainable while saving money. In this time of uncertainty, saving money is more important than ever, so most of the suggestions here can help reduce expenses: What are some sustainable practices that save you money? Here are some suggestions- challenge your household to pick at least 10 options to implement over the next month: Get an electric car for your next vehicle to save on gas Drive less and combine errands when you do.  Bike or walk for trips that are less than 2 miles Drive or train instead of fly for vacations  Wool Dryer Balls cut drying time/energy for laundry by helping separate and air out clothes in the dryer  Wash laundry in cold water saves 90% energy over hot- and preserves colors and fabrics Hang your clothes to dry (this will preserve them as well)  Consider installing a heat pump dryer to save 20%-60% Purchase water efficient fixtures  Place a brick or full jug in your toilet tank to save water Shorter showers (time them using songs/playlists!) Get bulk liquid soap and/or concentrate, and refillable soap dispensers  Choose soap bars and shampoo bars instead of liquids Use reusable safety or electric razor instead of disposable ones Use a menstrual cup instead of disposable tampons/pads Buy white vinegar and baking soda in bulk and make your own cleaning supplies! Buy local produce and eat less meat (especially red meat) Reduce packaging by reusing and buying in bulk Get rid second fridges/freezers (food often gets forgotten/expired there anyway) Switch to an induction stovetop for cooking, instead of a gas range Use reusable and washable rags instead of paper towels! Make your own DIY rags from old/stained/ripped cloths and towels Regrow some of your own produce (surprisingly, a lot of produce can be regrown from the discards! celery, romaine lettuce, chives, etc!) Save and reuse jars from pasta sauce, salsa etc instead of buying tupperware and glasses Use reusable straws, cloth napkins, utensils instead of disposables Use reusable water bottles instead of buying bottled water Select energy-efficient lights like LEDS Invest in energy-saving smart power strips home to reduce energy drain Use thermal insulating curtains and block drafts under exterior doors Set electronics(laptops, computers, printers, etc) to hibernate automatically, putting electronics (TVs, video games etc) that are on 'standby' on a powerstrip and turning it all off so it's not draining unnecessary power, etc, too Lower the heat/ac and dress for the weather instead Get solar water heaters, solar PV panels or geothermal energy to save on electricity (recoup your investment in around 8 years and get savings from then on)  Switch to LED bulbs  Use a programmable thermostat to cut back on heating/cooling  Insulate your furnace and water heater  Get a home energy audit (available for free from Pepco & BGE energy providers!). They will provide swaps for more energy efficient fixtures and make energy saving suggestions for your home. During COVID, these are also offered virtually DIY upcycled crafts for gifts/cards Downsizing the size of your home to something smaller, and in a walkable/bikeable area with public transit Buy used (Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, ebay, or thrift stores)  Buy things that will last instead of fast fashion, quick trends, or low-quality things that could break/fall apart easily  Switch from gas to electric (stoves, heaters, etc)  Get clean energy! Even if you can’t afford panels, you can get a PPA, or if you rent, you can pay your energy bill to renewable energy providers Use your balcony or backyard to grow vegetables or plant a pollinator garden Explore and use green landscaping practices for your plants, yard, and trees  care for your trees—make sure you are watering, pruning, and mulching correctly to ensure healthy trees Switch to solar-powered or LED outdoor lighting Trade gas-powered equipment for manual or electric versions Utilize the University of Maryland Extension Home & Garden Information Center's Climate-Resilient Gardening Story Map to find examples of how to adapt your gardens and community green spaces to mitigate and adapt to climate change Listen to the University of Maryland Extension's monthly Garden Thyme Podcast Communicating your values, goals, and intentions with others can inspire them to follow suit! Asking them for their input, advice, and ideas can help motivate them to take action with you. If you live with your family or housemates, it will be easier to implement changes if everyone is part of the process of setting goals, determining strategies, and implementing improvements! Make it a team effort with your household! And, share your list and progress with others too- post to social media, or send a message to a handful of close friends, neighbors, or relatives, about the savings you noticed and how you achieved them! \nSite Title: Green at Home Guide | SustainableUMD\nHeader: Bring Sustainability Home!\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/get-involved/green-home-guide"

We’ve compiled some coping strategies to help navigate the stress and anxiety that our current crises can trigger.We are all connected to one another, our ecosystem, and other species. Taking care of our well being includes caring for the greater good.  While our attention is drawn to how many people come into contact with the resources we rely on, and the places they are sourced from, it’s also an opportunity to be grateful for everything that contributes to our subsistence ⎼ the entire supply chain and all the labor and natural resource extraction. We can extend and cultivate that gratitude in order to grow our contentment- focusing on what we do have and what we really need, rather than focusing on what we don’t have, or comparing whether we have the most, biggest, or best of everything. By developing gratitude, and contentment with consuming less, we can also ensure that other people and species are able to survive. \nSite Title: Coping with Climate Anxiety- Toolkit | SustainableUMD\nHeader: Coping with Climate Anxiety- Toolkit\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/get-involved/sustainable-distancing-guide"

CHP is already an efficient process but planned projects will make it and campus buildings even more efficient, thereby decreasing the carbon intensity of each facility. As of 2020, all electricity coming from sources other than CHP is sourced from renewable sources and any carbon emissions associated with powering new facilities are offset. There is plenty of opportunity for every person on campus to contribute toward reaching these goals!

To address the environmental impact of this travel, the university will implement a carbon offset program to negate 100% of the carbon emissions associated with air travel starting in 2018. A Carbon Offset Fund Committee reporting to the University Sustainability Council will select verified projects that sequester or prevent carbon emissions and determine the best process for administering the program.  \nSite Title: Climate Action Plan | Office of Sustainability\nHeader: Air Travel\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/progress/climate-action-plan"

        "Content": "By Liam Farrell for Maryland Today /  Apr 29, 2021 The University of Maryland is redoubling its efforts to fight climate change, committing to carbon neutrality by 2025 through a mix of infrastructure improvement, electric vehicle purchases and targeted investments in sustainability. UMD President Darryll J. Pines announced the new goal, which lops a quarter century off a previous plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, during his inauguration speech last week. “We must continue our academic leadership in research, education and service relative to climate science, sustainability and environmental stewardship of our natural resources. I challenge our faculty to become leaders in developing solutions to one of the grand challenges of our time,” he said during the Earth Day address. “We all must become climate ambassadors.”   Carlo Colella, vice president and chief administrative officer, said UMD is well positioned to take advantage of the growing cost-effectiveness of renewable energy such as solar and wind power over fossil fuels. In addition, through a public-private partnership called the NextGen Energy Program, the university will kick off a plan next year to replace, renew and modernize UMD’s aging energy system, which provides heating, cooling and electric services to campus.     To make the university fleet more efficient, its approximately 1,000 light-duty trucks and vehicles will be replaced with electric models as current vehicles wear out. Light electric and gas vehicles are relatively comparable right now in terms of cost, Colella said, and the administration will continue to search for grants and other financial incentives to make it more feasible to replace costly vehicles like diesel buses. As the university continues to track emerging technologies that allow for incorporation of low- and zero-emission fuel options, carbon offsets—verified investments that go toward projects to cut greenhouse gases elsewhere to compensate for campus emissions—will for now remain a piece of the puzzle. Offsets are purchased in a competitive bid process, and have included projects such as building wind farms, planting trees and capturing methane (a gas with far more powerful greenhouse effects than carbon dioxide) emitted from landfills. “We are in a good place, and we got there by improving a lot of efficiencies and purchasing offsets,” Colella said, noting that UMD was already more than halfway to the previous 2050 target. “That’s great progress to build upon.” The larger picture of what carbon neutrality will cost and when it will be possible at UMD without purchasing offsets will depend heavily on how the nation’s energy and sustainability sectors evolve, Colella said. Another factor is the availability of governmental support for green initiatives following President Joe Biden’s call last week to slash U.S. emissions to half of 2005 levels by 2030. In just a short period of time, Colella said, environmentally friendly power and infrastructure options could move from cost-prohibitive to cost-competitive. “It’s our obligation to be good stewards,” he said. “We all have to prioritize this.” \nSite Title: UMD to Accelerate Carbon Neutrality Goal to 2025 | SustainableUMD\nHeader: \nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/news/umd-accelerate-carbon-neutrality-goal-2025"

Cold, filtered water pours easily into the dispensers which are the right shape and size for most bottles to refill. We recommend carrying and refilling a reusable water bottle instead of purchasing bottled water. Water sold in single-use plastic results in unnecessary waste, along with pollution and emissions resulting from manufacturing and distributing water bottles. Student campaigns and a state policy banning the spending of state funds on bottled water both sparked interest in encouraging reusable water bottles by installing water bottle filling stations across campus. Through the \"Terps<3the Tap\" project, dozens of filtered water filling stations have been installed on campus, encouraging the campus community to reuse and refill, instead of consuming single-use bottled water.  The project was completed with a grant from the University Sustainability Fund.  Make the sustainable choice to refill your bottle! If you notice a filling station that requires a filter to be changed or any other repairs please submit awork orderto Facilities Management. \nSite Title: Reusable Water Bottle Filling Stations | SustainableUMD\nHeader: Reusable Water Bottle Filling Stations\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/topics/water/reusable-water-bottle-filling-stations"

        "Content": "To date, over 102 bottle filling stations have been installed across campus due to the efforts of student advocates, the Sustainability Council, the Sustainability Fund, the Office of Sustainability, Facilities Management, Residential Facilities, University Recreation & Wellness and others. In spring 2011, undergraduate students proposed that the University Sustainability Council work toward reducing bottled water consumption on campus.  The Sustainability Council created a Bottled Water Committee comprised of students, faculty, and staff representing many areas of campus. This committee examined the issue, surveyed the campus, and explored options.  They presented recommendations to the Sustainability Council, including proposing bottle filling stations on campus.  The Sustainability Council established a Water Filling Station Work Group which began meeting in fall 2012.  Representatives from the student body, Facilities Management, Residential Facilities, Campus Recreation, CSPAC, the Office of Sustainability, and the campus libraries quickly reached an agreement on which filling stations would best fit the campus needs.  Locations of the filling stations were determined from a Bottle Water Survey distributed by the Bottled Water Committee, Building Usage Data from the Office of the Registrar, student input, and building occupant input.  Phone interviews with other institutions that had installed filling stations also helped inform the work group’s decisions. The Water Filling Station Work Group absorbed a previous student-proposed Sustainability Fund grant project, Hydrate UMD.  Hydrate UMD similarly sought to install filling stations on campus, but the Water Filling Station Work Group approached the project with a larger scope.  As a Sustainability Fund proposal, the workgroup secured funding to install 64 filling stations across campus:  in residential, academic, and administrative buildings. In 2014, the Water Filling Station Work Group again secured support from the Sustainability Fund to install 38 additional stations. In 2021, SGA allocated $60,000 to install 20 additional water bottle filling stations across residence halls. Tap water is also perfectly safe to drink so consider filling up your water bottle at the faucet next time as well!  \nSite Title: Reusable Water Bottle Filling Stations | SustainableUMD\nHeader: History of Terps Heart the Tap and Campus Bottle Filling Stations\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/topics/water/reusable-water-bottle-filling-stations"

        "Content": "In 2010 Facilities Management adopted the Mini Bin Waste Collection Program for all offices and individual workspaces on campus. This mini trash bin has replaced all standard, desk-side trash cans and is to be used by employees to collect all non-recyclable trash that will be sent to the landfill. Desk-side recycling bins are provided to collect all recyclable material. Housekeeping services will regularly empty all desk-side recycling bins. Individuals are responsible for emptying their own Mini Bin into a centrally located landfill/trash bin in common areas rather than having plastic-lined trash bins at each workstation. Any desk-side recycling bin containing trash will be left for the employee to empty. Please Note: This program affects offices only. Housekeeping Services will empty both trash and recycling bins in all communal spaces on campus. Mixed Recycling:Our campus has a mixed recycling program. All of your mixed paper, plastic bottles, and aluminum cans should be placed in your desk-side recycling container. Foods, liquids, and plastic bags should never go in a recycle bin. Glass can be recycled separately in glass collection dumpsters. The Mini Bin has proven to be effective in minimizing landfill waste. Waste audits reveal that the majority of waste generated in offices on campus can be recycled or composted. The objective of this program is to reduce the amount of landfill waste generated on campus, develop mindfulness related to individual waste generation, and help increase the overall campus recycling rate. Thank you for your support of this important step towards a more sustainable University of Maryland.

Tailpipe emissions that form ground level ozone can lead to a variety of serious health conditions. That’s why it’s important to be aware of how idling impacts those around you and turn your engine off at every opportunity.Car exhaust contains air pollutants that can cause cancer, respiratory issues, reproductive effects, birth defects, and other serious illnesses.One minute of idling produces more carbon monoxide than three packs of cigarettes.Exposure to vehicle exhaust increases the risk of death from heart and lung disease.Children breathe 50% more air per pound than adults. Because of their developing lungs and higher breathing rates, air pollution is especially dangerous to children.Car exhaust increases the symptoms of asthma—the most common chronic illness in children, and the cause of most school absences.\nSite Title: Idle-Free UMD | SustainableUMD\nHeader: HEALTH RISKS\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/topics/transport/idle-free-umd"

Wasteful and unnecessary, idling is harder on engines and less fuel-efficient than driving. Consider the economic impact of idling the next time you’re behind the wheel.Idling leaves residue on spark plugs, increases fuel consumption by up to 5% and can reduce the life of your exhaust system.Excessive idling can damage your engine and add as much as $2,000 per year in maintenance costs.Idling consumes up to a gallon of fuel an hour and wastes about six billion gallons of fuel each year.The average person wastes ~1-2 tanks of gas each year by idling.Idling for more than 10 seconds consumes more fuel than restarting your engine.\nSite Title: Idle-Free UMD | SustainableUMD\nHeader: WASTE AND COST\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/topics/transport/idle-free-umd"

If everyone in Maryland eliminated unnecessary idling, local ecosystems would be healthier.Each gallon of fuel burned emits about 20 lbs of CO2 and introduces nitrogen into the atmosphere.Over the course of a year, one car idling for just 5 minutes each day can emit 25 lbs of harmful air pollutants and 260 lbs of CO2.Excess nitrogen can fuel the growth of algae blooms in the bay, which can block sunlight from reaching underwater grasses and create low oxygen “dead zones” that suffocate marine life.Airborne nitrogen is one of the largest sources of pollution affecting the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Poor water quality affects submerged bay grasses, blue crab, oysters, and fish species.\nSite Title: Idle-Free UMD | SustainableUMD\nHeader: ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT\nLink: https://sustainability.umd.edu/topics/transport/idle-free-umd"
