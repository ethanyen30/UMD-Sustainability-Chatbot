Do you know something sustainable happening at UMD that isn’t already mentioned?
Use the textbox below to submit a fact. I’ll check if it’s valid and show whether it’s good to add.
Before you add a fact, check if the chatbot can currently answer anything about that fact.
After you add it, check again and you should get a response that includes your fact!

You’ll also see a list of all user submitted facts in the expandable section below.
Note that some info may be false because this is just for users to experience with RAG applications.
