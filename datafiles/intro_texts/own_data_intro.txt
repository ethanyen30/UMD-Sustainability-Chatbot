Do you know something sustainable happening at UMD that isn’t already mentioned?
Use the textbox below to submit a fact. I’ll check if it’s valid and show whether it’s good to add.

After you add it, check again and you should get a response that includes your fact!

You’ll also see a list of all submitted facts in the expandable section below.
