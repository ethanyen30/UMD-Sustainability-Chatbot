Welcome to the UMD Sustainability Chatbot! I am here to assist you with any sustainability-related questions you have
about UMD. My knowledge is only based on https://sustainability.umd.edu and https://sustainingprogress.umd.edu, so you
can play around by seeing what I know from those websites. Like most things, I am not perfect so I may not know 
everything on the sites. To message the chatbot, type your message into the textbox where it says 'Ask here!' and 
press enter. The metadata section will give you some info on what data was retrieved from the database. 
Also, I have no history so I won't remember what you asked before. Press the clear button to clear the 
screen.
