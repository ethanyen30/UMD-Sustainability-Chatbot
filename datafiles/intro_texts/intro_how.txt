## ðŸ§  How This Chatbot Works

This app uses a technique called **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**:
1. Your question is turned into a vector (numerical representation).
2. That vector is used to find the most relevant content from our vector database (Pinecone).
3. Retrieved content is passed to a large language model (LLM) to generate a custom response.

This approach ensures the AI generates helpful, grounded answers based on trusted UMD sources.
